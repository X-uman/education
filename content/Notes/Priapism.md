- [[Penis Anatomy]] [[Penis]]
- Presentation with Painful Erected penis in absence of stimulation (> 4 h)

### Types 
- High Flow Priapism: Due to Increased Arterial Flow i.e. Artery getting dilated but veins are not obstructed , this is due to loss of **sympathetic tone of arteries**: 
	- [[Spinal Lesions]] 
	- [[Spinal Cord Injuries]] leading to [[neurogenic shock]] 
	- [[Retroperitoneum]] Injuries
	- [[Papaverine]] Injections
	- Arterial rupture inside penis 
- Low Flow: Due to venous [[Notes/Obstruction]]
	- [[Hyperviscosity syndrome]]
	- [[venous thrombosis]] 
	- Venous obstruction

#### Investigations
- [[Color flow doppler USG]] 
- ABG of Penile Blood:
	- High Flow Type: Increased Oxygen into penis
	- Low Flow Type: Decreased Oxygen into penis
- CBC: Check RBC, WBC: Too much increases blood viscosity and lead to vasoocclusive crisis in Low flow priapsm

#### Management
- High Flow: Inj. [[Phenylephrine]] or [[Epinephrine]] within 36hrs
- Low flow:
	- >36 hrs: [[Shunt]] Operations: Between Cavernosa and Spongiosum
		- Winter Shunt: Made distally
		- Sacher's Shunt: Made proximally
		- Grey Hack shunt: Corpus cavernosum to Saphenous vein 
	- Emergency Aspiration

| Parameter                | High-flow Priapism                                 | Low-flow Priapism                                                                                                                                                |

| Pathophysiology          | Arterial-cavernosal fistula or trauma to the penis | Venous occlusion, typically due to sickle cell disease, medications, or idiopathic causes                                                                        |
| Blood Flow               | High arterial inflow into the corpora cavernosa    | Impaired venous outflow from the corpora cavernosa                                                                                                               |
| Erection Characteristics | Erection is typically painless                     | Erection may be painful and progressive                                                                                                                          |
| Appearance of Penis      | Penis may appear full and tumescent                | Penis may appear rigid and rigid, with rigidity extending to the glans and may be purplish in color                                                              |
| Treatment Approach       | Observation or selective arterial embolization     | Aspiration of blood from corpora cavernosa, injection of sympathomimetic agents (e.g., phenylephrine), surgical shunting, or implantation of a penile prosthesis |
