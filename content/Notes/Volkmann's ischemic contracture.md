### Introduction
- Ischemic injury to muscles and nerves of flexor compartment of forearm due to occlusion or tear of brachial artery
- Especially muscles supplied by Anterior interosseous artery which is an end artery mainly Flexor pollicis longus and medial half of flexor digitorum profundus
- Nerve: Anterior interosseous nerve 

### Causes
- [[Compartment syndrome]] (neglected)
- [[Brachial artery injury]] particularly in [[Supracondylar humeral fracture]] 
- [[Crush syndrome]] 
### Pathogenesis
- If Ischemia > 4 h: Muscle necrosis sets in
- Later fibroblastic proliferation and adherence to surrounding structure which fixes muscle position, reduces mobility, stiffness and joint contracture
- Compression as well as ischemia of nerves
	- [[Median nerve]] palsy
	- [[Ulnar nerve palsy]] 
### Presentation
- Impending contracture: resembles [[Compartment syndrome]] 
- Stretch pain: in flexor aspect of forearm on passively extending fingers


| Severity         | Muscles involved                                                          | Nerve involvement                      | Contractures                              | Causes                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Mild (localized) | Limited to extrinsic finger flexors<br>Usually 2 or 3 fingers             | Hand sensibility & strength are normal | Fixed joint contracture not present       |                        |
| Moderate         | Primarily affects FDP & FPL, and part of FDS. Occasionally FDS, FCR & FCU | Commonly median<br>Rarely radial       | Claw hand deformity, intrinsic minus hand |                        |
| Severe           | Affect forearm extensors & flexors                                        |                                        | Contractures, wasting                     | Brachial artery damage |

### Management
- Prevention: Manage [[Compartment syndrome]] for impending VIC
- Conservative: physical therapy, dynamic elbow splint
	- [[Banjo splint]] 
	- [[Volkmann splint]] 
- Surgical: 
	- [[Maxpage operation]]: release of flexor muscles from their origins from the one and allowing it to slide down until full extension 
	- [[tendon transfer]] procedures, 
	- Ulnar nerve decompression (severely impaired hand function)
	- Muscle sliding operations
