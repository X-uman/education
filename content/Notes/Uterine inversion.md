### Classification
- Partial: Inside cervix
- Complete inversion: Outside cervix
- [[Pelvic organ prolapse]]: Outside Vagina
- Acute vs chronic

### Risk factors
- Fundal attachment of placenta
- [[Distended uterus]] 
- [[Valsalva maneuver]] 
- [[Placenta accreta spectrum]]
- [[Short umbilical cord]] 
- [[Ehler-Danlos Syndrome]] 
- Improper [[Placenta delivery]] 
- Excessive fundal pressure
### Presentation
- Brisk [[Post-partum hemorrhage]] and shock
	- [[neurogenic shock]] due to tension on nerves due to stretching of infundibulo-pelvic ligament, compression of ovaries, peritoneal irritation
- Prolapsed uterus, Pain, [[Urinary retention]] 
- Absent fundus on palpation
##### Clinical signs
- Shock
- Cupping or dimpling of fundal surface
- Pear shaped mass protruding outside vulva with broad end pointing downward and reddish purple in color
### Management
- Halt [[Active management of third stage of labor]] 
- Treat shock
- Urgent manual reposition of uterine inversion; (*see also [[Hernia reduction]]* )
- [[Hydrostatic reduction]]

- Raise foot end of bed
- [[Tocolytics]] + Reattempt for stable patient
- IF ineffective / Patient unstable: Surgical repair by [[Haultainâ€™s operation]] 
- Following successful repositioning: [[Uterotonics]] and keep hand inside until uterus is fully contracted
- Only after contracted uterus, [[Placenta delivery]] is done 
	- Placenta can also be removed before repositioning the uterus to facilitate replacement 
- Pack vagina with antiseptic roller gauze 
- Antibiotics 

### Chronic inversion
##### Clinical presentation
- [[Notes/Abnormal uterine bleeding|Abnormal uterine bleeding]] 
- [[Pelvic organ prolapse]]
- [[Chronic pelvic pain]]
- [[vaginal discharge]]
