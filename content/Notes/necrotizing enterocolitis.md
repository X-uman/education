### Risk factors
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]] 
- [[Surfactant deficiency]] 
- Breast milk has a protective effect
- < 3 months old infants, 2-4 days old–highest prevalence when starting oral milk feeding

### Pathogenesis
- Commonest sites: Distal ileum and proximal colon
- The causes of necrotizing enterocolitis are not fully understood but multiple factors contribute to the development of the condition.
    - Intestinal wall perfusion and [[motility disorders]]
    - Defective or underdeveloped immune system
    - [[Intestinal microbial overgrowth]] like in [[Formula feeding ]]
    - Rapid increase of enteral nutrition 

### Presentation
- Features of [[Acute Gastroenteritis]]: [[necrosis]] of [[Layers of intestinal walls]]: [[Per rectal bleeding.canvas|Per rectal bleeding]] 
- Features of [[bowel obstruction]]
- Features of [[Peritonitis]] 
- Features of [[Ascites]] 
- Features of [[Septic shock]] 
- [[Bell staging of NE.png]] 

### Complications
- [[Bowel Perforation]] :
	   - Abdominal radiography: [[pneumoperitoneum]]
	   - Treatment: surgery (resection and anastomosis)
- [[Short bowel syndrome]] after surgery
- Peritonitis
- Sepsis
- Mild GIT disturbance to Fulminant Intestinal Gangrene, Perforation, Sepsis and Shock
- Abdominal Distention, tenderness, Ileus, Diarrhea, Frank or occult blood in Stool

### Diagnostics
- CBC: 
	- Neutrophil counts < 1500/μL are associated with a poor prognosis.
	- The degree of [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]] correlates with the severity of NEC.
- ↑ [[Inflammatory markers]] 

**Abdominal radiography:** *(seeing air where it should not be seen)*
   - [[Pneumatosis intestinalis]]: bubbles of gas within the wall of the intestine 
- Portal venous gas ([[pneumatosis hepatis]])
- **Signs of [[Notes/Obstruction|Obstruction]]** 
	- Dilated intestinal loops: 
	- Air‑fluid levels
- Increased intestinal wall thickness due to edema
- [[Pneumoperitoneum]] as a result of [[bowel perforation]]

**Abdominal ultrasound**
- Indication: Ultrasound may be helpful for diagnosing NEC when abdominal radiography is inconclusive.
- Findings
   - Pneumatosis intestinalis
   - Portal venous gas
   - Increased intestinal wall thickness
   - Decreased intestinal wall perfusion in doppler

### Management
- [[Conservative Management]]
	- IV broad-spectrum antibiotics: e.g., ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole for anaerobic coverage 
	- Radiographic monitoring: plain supine abdominal radiographs every 6–12 hours in the initial phase of the disease
- Surgical treatment also instituted when
	- [[Peritonitis]]: IV Antibiotics + Surgery for [[Bowel Perforation]]
	- Surgery: primary peritoneal drainage and/or laparotomy with necrotic bowel excision
	- Indications: perforation, peritonitis and/or clinical worsening despite medical therapy

### Prevention
- [[Fetal lung maturity]] should be ensured so that GIT organs get adequate oxygenation 
### Differential diagnosis
- [[Spontaneous intestinal perforation]]
- [[bowel obstruction]]
- [[Acute Gastroenteritis]] 
- [[Food protein-induced colitis]]
