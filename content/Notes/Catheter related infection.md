### Etiology

### Diagnostics
- endoluminal brush passed down the catheter and withdrawn into a polythene sheath. The brush tip is cultured at the same time as performing blood cultures.
- culture blood withdrawn through the catheter and compare this with peripheral blood cultures. If the colony count from the catheter sample is five or more times higher than that from peripheral blood, then line sepsis is probable.
