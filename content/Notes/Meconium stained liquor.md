### Management
- Assess the baby's status whether the baby is vigorous or not
- If baby is not vigorous
	- Avoid Stimulating the baby (baby's reflex may cause it to swallow)
	- Avoid intrapartum suction of mouth and nose
	- **Routine intubation** is not recommended, but make sure someone who can intubate is present during resuscitation
