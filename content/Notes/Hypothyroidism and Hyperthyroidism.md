### Diagnostics
- [[Thyroid function tests]] 

Low TRH and TSH levels

#Causes of Hyperthyroidism
	Primary Hyperthyroidism--[[Grave's disease]]
	Secondary---Pituitary Adenoma increasing TSH production
	Toxic [[Thyroid Adenoma]] 
	Exogenous Administration of T4: ==Thyrotoxicosis factitia==
	Excess Iodine Consumption: Jod Bosedow toxicosis
	Thyroid gland consumption of animals: ==Hamburger toxicosis==
	Multinodular Toxic [[Goitr]]: Plummer disease
	Hypothalamus--excessive TRH--> T3/4, TRH, TSH high


#Causes of [[Hypothyroidism]]
	

- #Management of Hyperthyroidism
	-   Propranolol
	-   Thio propyl Uracil/ Carbimazole
	-   Subtotal Thyroidectomy---not to remove parathyroid gland, Recurrent laryngeal Nerve
	-   Radio-active Iodine--Long term ADR--Hypothyroidism

- #management of Hypothyroidism
	- Iodine supplementation
	- Thyroxine
		- Supplement: 0.1mg
		- substitution: 0.2mg
		- Suppression: 0.3mg to suppress TSH in Papillary thyroid carcinoma

- [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
- [[Thyroid examination]]
