### Introduction
| Type     | Description                                                                              | Clinical presentation      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Type I   | Sliding hiatal hernia                                                                    | Asymptomatic, [[GERD]]     |
|          | - Most common type (95% of cases)                                                        |                            |
|          | - GEJ and gastric cardia slide into posterior mediastinum                                |                            |
|          | - Gastric fundus remains below diaphragm (hourglass stomach)                             |                            |
| Type II  | Paraesophageal hiatal hernia                                                             | [[Esophageal obstruction]] |
|          | - Part of gastric fundus herniates into thorax                                           |                            |
|          | - GEJ remains below diaphragm                                                            |                            |
| Type III | Mixed hiatal hernia                                                                      | Mixed                      |
|          | - Mix of types I and II                                                                  |                            |
|          | - GEJ and portion of gastric fundus prolapse through hiatus                              |                            |
| Type IV  | Complex hiatal hernia                                                                    | [[Esophageal obstruction]] |
|          | - Herniation of any abdominal structure in addition to stomach <br>(e.g., spleen, colon) |                            |
|          | - Rarest type                                                                            |                            |

### Etiology
- The etiology is multifactorial. 
- Related to [[Gastroesophageal junction]] anatomy
- Lax diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus
	- Advanced age: weakness of Phreno-esophageal ligament
	- Smoking : causes loss of elastin fibers in [[diaphragmatic crura]] 
	- Obesity: Deposition of fat in and around the crura widens the hiatus
	- Genetic predisposition (rare)
- Prolonged periods of increased [[Abdominal Compartment]] pressure 
	- Pregnancy
	- Ascites
	- Chronic cough
	- Chronic constipation

---
### Pathogenesis
- [[Gastroesophageal junction]] 

----
### Epidemiology


---

---
### Diagnostics
- Most sensitive: [[Barium study]]
	- Also used to evaluate size and type
- Endoscopy: to evaluate size and type and assess for complications by evaluating mucosal condition 

---
### Management
- [[Personal history]] modification
- Medical: [[Antacids]]
- Surgical treatment 
	- Complications of [[GERD]]
	- Para-esophageal hernia at risk of incarceration and strangulation
- Surgical procedures
	- Hernia reduction
	- Crural repair +/- Prosthetic reinforcement
	- [[Fundoplication]]
	- Mesh repairs

---

### Complications
- [[GERD]] and related complications
- Incarceration and strangulation
