### Functions
The placenta serves several crucial functions during pregnancy, including nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and fetus, hormone production, immune protection, and waste elimination. Here's a table outlining the mechanisms of these functions:

| Function           | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nutrient Exchange  | - **Diffusion:** Small molecules such as oxygen, glucose, and amino acids pass from the maternal blood into the fetal blood through concentration gradients.<br> - **Active Transport:** Specific ions and nutrients, such as calcium and iron, are actively transported across the placental membrane to meet the demands of the developing fetus. |
| Gas Exchange       | - **Simple Diffusion:** Oxygen from the maternal blood diffuses into the fetal blood, while carbon dioxide moves from the fetal blood to the maternal blood, driven by concentration gradients.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Hormone Production | - The placenta produces hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (hPL), progesterone, and estrogen.<br> - These hormones support pregnancy by maintaining the uterine lining, preventing menstrual cycles, and regulating fetal growth and development.                                                        |
| Immune Protection  | - The placenta acts as a barrier, preventing harmful substances, such as bacteria and large molecules, from passing from the mother to the fetus.<br> - It also produces antibodies to protect the fetus from infections, providing passive immunity until the newborn's immune system develops.                                                    |
| Waste Elimination  | - Metabolic waste products, such as carbon dioxide and urea, are transported from the fetal blood into the maternal blood through diffusion and active transport.<br> - These waste products are then eliminated from the maternal body through the kidneys, lungs, and other excretory organs.                                                     |
