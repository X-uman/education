- [[Dystrophin]] Gene [[Genetic mutations]] leading to complete absence of protein
- [[X-linked Recessive]]
- Can be Hereditary or Sporadic

### Pathogenesis
- Muscle Necrosis
- Inflammation
- Fibrosis and fat infiltration

### Clinical features
- Early onset < 5 y
- [[Proximal myopathy]] (also see [[Myopathy]] )
	- Initially Proximal muscles weakness and atrophy of lower limbs (Pelvic girdle) which progresses to upper body and distal limbs
	- [[Motor Examination]] 
		- Increase bulk despite degeneration (due to fat deposition): 
			- Calf [[Pseudohypertrophy]] 
			- Valley sign: due to pseudohypertrophy of scapular muscles and deltoids 
		- Weak Muscle reflexes
		- Waddling Gait (Like a duck)
- [[Bulbar palsy]] not typical (unlike [[Spinal muscular atrophy]])
- [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]]: Common cause of death
- [[Arrhythmias]]
- [[Respiratory failure]] due to respiratory muscles degeneration
- Cognitive impairment
- Late stages
	- Nocturnal hypoventilation
	- [[Dysphagia]], Vomiting, diarrhea, Constipation
	- Rarely: Bowel [[Pseudo-obstruction]]
- Life expectancy: approx. 30 y

### Diagnosis
- Gold standard: Muscle Biopsy with staining with Anti-dystrophin Antibody
- Specimem: Vastus lateralis/Gastrocnemius 
- On muscle biopsy: 
	- Decreased dystrophin staining: Becker
	- Absent dystrophin staining: Duchenne
- Other
	- [[Nerve conduction studies]] are normal
	- [[Electromyography]] shows myopathic features 
- [[Genetic studies]] : Detect Gene Mutation
- [[Myolysis Markers]] 

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Becker muscular dystrophy]] 
- [[Facioscapulohumoral Muscular dystrophy]] 
- [[Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy]] 
- [[Polymyositis]] 
- [[Spinal muscular atrophy]]
- [[Myotonic syndromes]]

### Treatment
- Multidisciplinary approach needed`
- [[Glucocorticoids]] reduce the rate of progression of disease. Avoid Fluorinated GCCs
- [[Eteplirsen]]
