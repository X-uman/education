- Can be measured at any time 
- Results may be altered by a variety of conditions or treatments, e.g., sickle cell trait, chronic kidney disease.

- HbA1c cannot be considered a reliable tool in such cases and other results (plasma glucose levels, glycated serum protein, or glycated albumin) should be taken into account when diagnosing and monitoring diabetes. 


Factors resulting in a falsely high HbA1c
   - Increased RBC lifespan: e.g., iron and/or [[vitamin B12 deficiency]], [[splenectomy]], [[aplastic anemia]]
   - Altered hemoglobin: [[CKD]] Due to high carbamylated [[hemoglobin]]  
   - Assay interference: heavy alcohol use, chronic opiate use, high-dose [[aspirin]], severe hypertriglyceridemia, [[uremia]], [[hyperbilirubinemia]]

Factors resulting in a falsely low HbA1c
   - Decreased RBC lifespan: e.g., due to acute blood loss, [[hemoglobinopathies]] such as sickle cell trait/disease, thalassemia, G6PD-deficiency, [[cirrhosis]], hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, [[Anti-retroviral therapy]]
   - Increased erythropoiesis: e.g., due to EPO therapy, reticulocytosis, pregnancy (second and third trimesters), iron supplementation
	- Altered hemoglobin: high-dose vitamin C and E supplementation
	- Assay interference: low-dose aspirin
