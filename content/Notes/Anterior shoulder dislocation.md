### Presentation
- FOOSH
- Forced abduction and extension 
- The arm is typically held in external rotation and slight abduction 
- Shoulder extended, abducted, and externally rotated
### Clinical Tests
| Test                | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dugas Test          | - Patient attempts to touch opposite shoulder with affected arm, indicating inability to internally rotate<br>- Positive result suggests dislocation or subluxation |
| Callaway Test       | - Measures axillary diameter<br>- Useful in assessing shoulder dislocation and subluxation                                                                          |
| Bryant's Test       | - Evaluates for a lowered axillary fold<br>- Suggestive of shoulder dislocation                                                                                     |
| Hamilton Ruler Test | - Checks for the absence of the normal contour of the shoulder                                                                                                      |

### Diagnostics
- Preglenoid, Sub-coracoid and sub-clavicular 
- [[Hill-Sachs lesion]] 

### Reduction of Anterior dislocation
| Technique               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hippocratic Technique   | - Gentle traction on the wrist while the shoulder is counter-tractioned<br>- Used to reduce anterior shoulder dislocation                                                                                                            |
| [[Stimson's Technique]] | - Patient lies prone with the affected arm hanging over the edge of a table<br>- Weight (e.g., sandbag) applied to the wrist, allowing gravity to slowly reduce the dislocation                                                      |
| Milch Technique         | - Supine patient, shoulder abducted to 90 degrees and elbow flexed to 90 degrees<br>- Gentle longitudinal traction applied to the arm while the humerus is internally rotated                                                        |
| [[Kocher Technique]]    | - Also known as Kocher's method<br>- Progressive abduction, forward flexion, internal rotation, and extension of the shoulder until reduction is achieved<br>- May be associated with significant pain and risk of iatrogenic injury |
