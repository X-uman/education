### Incomplete LES relaxation
- [[Achalasia]]
- Esophago-gastric junction outflow obstruction 
### Major motility disorders
- Normal LES relaxation; high DCI; short DL; or absence of peristalsis
	- Absent contractility
	- Distal esophageal spasm
	- Hypercontractile or Jackhammer esophagus
### Minor motility disorders
- typically remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and usually resolve spontaneously
- Ineffective esophageal motility: a minor esophageal motility disorder characterized by acontractile breaks > 5 cm within normally occurring peristalsis in > 50% of swallows on high-resolution manometry
- Fragmented peristalsis: a minor esophageal motility disorder characterized by failed/weak peristalsis in > 50% of swallows on high-resolution esophageal manometry
### Secondary
- [[Chagas disease]]
- [[GERD]] associated
- [[Systemic sclerosis]] 
- [[Mixed connective tissue disorders]] 

### Presentation
- Intermittent dysphagia to liquids
- Episodic Retrosternal chest pain
- [[GERD]]
- Globus sensation
- [[URTS]] 
- Symptoms aggravated by stress and/or hot and cold foods/drinks

### Diagnostics
- Rule out life threatening causes of [[Chest Pain]] 
- Investigate for more common causes of dysphagia
	- [[Endoscopy]]: normal in motility disorders 
	- Esophageal pH monitoring for GERD
	- Esophageal [[Barium study]] 
		- Hypercontractile esophagus: usually normal
		- Distal esophageal spasm: multiple non-peristaltic contractions, which resemble pseudodiverticula (corkscrew appearance; rosary bead esophagus) 
		- May appear normal between acute episodes of DES
- [[High resolution manometry]]
- [[Barium study]] 
- [[esophageal manometry]]
