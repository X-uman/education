### Types
- Complete: [[Yoga position]], common in multipara 
- Frank/extended breech: Commonest and most favorable: Frank people are favorable, here hip is flexed, and knee extended  
- Footling breech: 
	- Both joints are partially extended
	- Do not attempt Cephalic version or Breech delivery
	- Increases risk for hypoxic injury and delivery-related trauma.
	- **Half breech**: One foot out of the cervix but other foot is frank 
- Knee breech: Do not attempt

### Fetus moves too less or too much 
- Fetus moves less
	- [[IUFD]]
	- [[Chromosomal anomalies]] 
- Fetus cannot move enough
	- [[oligohydramnios]]
	- [[multiple gestation]] 
- Fetus moves too much 
	- [[Polyhydramnios]] 
	- Non-[[Engagement]] 
- Nulliparity
- Maternal [[Hypothyroidism]] 
- Female sex
- Maternal anticonvulsant therapy
- Older maternal age
- Recurrence after previous breech

### Presentation
- Patients often report subcostal discomfort because the fetal head is in the fundus
- They may also perceive kicking in the lower abdomen when the breech is complete or incomplete.
- Breech presentation is most readily appreciated in the third trimester.
##### Examination
- [[Pelvic grips]] 
	- Fundal: Hard, easily ballotable head 
	- LUS: Soft, broad mass
- On transvaginal examination, the soft buttocks, anal orifice, or feet may be identified when the cervix is dilated but can be difficult to palpate when the cervix is closed. A foot is differentiated from a hand by the presence of the heel, while palpating a fist or a grasp may identify a hand.
### Diagnosis
- Ultrasound clearly identifies the fetal head in the fundus, buttocks in the lower uterine segment, extension or flexion of each hip and knee, and location of each foot.
- Hyperextension of the fetal head (defined by an extension angle greater than 90 degrees) is an important finding as it is a contraindication to vaginal birth.
### management
- Wait up to 36 weeks
- After 36 weeks
	- Not in labor: [[External cephalic version]]
		- Successful: [[Normal Labor]]
		- Unsuccessful
			- [[Assisted breech delivery]] if Breech is uncomplicated, patient consents
			- Elective [[Cesarean Section]] 
	- In labor
		- [[Internal podalic version]] 
### Complications of breech delivery
##### Fetal
- Non-[[Engagement]] complications 
- [[Birth injuries]] 
##### Maternal
- [[Prolonged labor]]
- [[Obstructed labor]]
	- [[Birth Canal Injuries]]
