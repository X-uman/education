| Psychomotor | Behavior: Arrest or abnormal behaviors during a seizure                                                                                                                                                |

- Post-ictal paralysis of involved area: [[Todd's paresis]] 
### Based on awareness
- Intact consciousness
- [[Altered consciousness]]: (such seizures are often referred to as auras)
	- Higher cortical symptoms
		- Dysphasia
		- Deja vu
		- Distortion of time
		- Affective changes usually fear
		- Illusions and formed hallucinations 
	- Motor symptoms (regions of bilateral hemispheres are involved)
		- Oral buccal moveent
		- Complex motor phenomena like bicycling or kicking  movements, flailing or arms, and running, jumping and spinning 
### Progression into GTCS or not
- Potential misdiagnosis and mistreatment if not noticed due to rapid progression 
### Diagnostics
- The lobe from which seizures originate should be determined.
- Epilepsy with focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures is classified as focal.
