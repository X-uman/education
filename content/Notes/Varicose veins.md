### Introduction


---
### Etiology
- See [[Chronic venous disease]] 

---
### Pathogenesis
- The vein wall changes include inflammatory cell infiltration and activation, dysfunctional smooth muscle cell proliferation, collagen deposition, decreased elastin content and increased matrix metalloproteinases. 
- These effects typically lead to loss of compliance, dilatation, elongation (causing tortuosity) and secondary valvular dysfunction. This process can be initiated anywhere in the venous tree.
- Secondary varicose veins may develop in patients with [[Post-thrombotic syndrome]] and in patients with congenital abnormalities such as the [[Klippelâ€“ Trenaunay syndrome]] or multiple [[Arteriovenous fistulae]].
