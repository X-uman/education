- Intraductal Ca in situ (80%)
- Lobular Ca in situ (20%)

### DCIS 
- Ducts are filled with Atypical Epithelial cells
- Basement Membrane is intact
- Arise from TDLU
- Several Patterns and Subtypes
- Presents as a unifocal Lesion
	- May show necrosis in lumen (Comedo Necrosis or Comedo-carcinoma)- cells proliferate rapidly into the lumen but cannot expand because BM is intact, which Leads to Death of cells and Subsequent necrosis. Not seen in IDC. [[Comedo necrosis.png]]
	- micro-calcifications may be present–Detected by [[Mammography]]
- Clinically–Lump–75% , Nipple Discharge–30%
- Prognosis: [[Van Nuys Classification system]] 
	- Excellent
	- 97% long term survival after mastectomy
- Higher risk of subsequent (ipsilateral)

##### Radiology
- Has a pattern of [[Microcalcifications]] 
### LCIS(20%)
- Acini are filled with atypical Epithelial cells
- BM of acini are intact
- Arise from TDLU
- Cells are relatively monomorphic
- Frequently Multi-centric and Bilateral
- 1/3rd of LCIS Patients, if untreated develop Invasive Ca on either same or other breast
- Does not produce mass–can be detected late
- Macrocalcifications are rare
