### Class 
- 


### Mechanism
- A [[Vitamin K deficiency]] antagonist that inhibits hepatic epoxide reductase, thereby blocking synthesis (recycling) of the active, reduced form of vitamin K
- [[Protein C]] get depleted earlier than others, [[Hypercoagulable state]], prevented by giving [[Unfractionated heparin]]
- Vitamin K dependent factors: 2, 7, 9, 10 



### Indications
- [[stasis]]


### Contraindications
- 


### Protocol/Procedure
- 


### Cautions
- 


### Complications
- [[skin necrosis]] due to Protein C depletion


### Management of Complications
- coagulation factors replacement
	- [[Vitamin K deficiency]] 
	- [[FFP]], [[PCC]] 
- Replace depleted protein C
- Prevent coagulation immediately using [[Unfractionated heparin]]
