- Stable mother and fetus
- preterm fetus 
- emergency management is at stand by
	- [[Blood Transfusion]]
	- [[Cesarean Section]]
- Stop after term or in emergency of placenta previa 
## Conduct
1. Admit the patient
2. Monitor Bleeding, Hematocrit, give [[Hematinics]], after [[Cross matching]] 
3. Exclude other sources of bleeding by examination using [[Cusco's speculum]]
4. [[tocolytics]] 
5. [[Rh prophylaxis]] 
6. [[Fetal lung maturity]] 

| Management Measures       | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Antenatal corticosteroids | Administer to patients who experience bleeding before 34 weeks of gestation and in whom delivery in the next seven days is anticipated.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Correction of anemia      | Oral or parenteral iron supplementation may be needed for optimal correction of anemia. Parenteral iron therapy has the advantages of a faster rise in hemoglobin levels and less gastric upset compared with oral therapy.                                                                                                         |
| Anti-D immune globulin    | Administer to RhD-negative patients who have bleeding from placenta previa. Readministration may not be necessary if rebleeding occurs within three weeks of administration. Use is also guided by postpartum Kleihauer-Betke or flow cytometry results.                                                                            |
| Fetal assessment          | Continuous fetal monitoring is indicated in cases of active vaginal bleeding. Nonstress testing may be performed in pregnancies with coexistent vasa previa to detect evidence of cord compression.                                                                                                                                 |
| Tocolysis                 | Not routinely used in the management of placenta previa due to lack of proven benefits and known possible harms. However, may be considered in patients with contractions while administering antenatal corticosteroids if bleeding is diminishing or ceased and delivery is not otherwise mandated by maternal or fetal condition. |
| Autologous blood donation | Considered in some cases, although most pregnant patients may not meet standard criteria for autologous donation. Additionally, it may not be cost-effective compared to allogeneic blood transfusion.                                                                                                                              |
| Cerclage                  | Generally not recommended due to lack of high-quality evidence of efficacy and safety. However, presence of stable placenta previa is not a contraindication to cerclage placement when indicated for cervical insufficiency.                                                                                                       |
| Pessary and progesterone  | Investigational approach showing promising results in reducing bleeding and preterm birth in patients with placenta previa and high risk of preterm birth. More data needed before widespread adoption.                                                                                                                             |
