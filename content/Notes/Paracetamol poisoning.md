CYP2E1 enzymes: 5% (toxicity)
Unchanged in urine: 5%

- Children < 12 y: > 200mg/kg
- CLD/malnutrition: >2g 

### Affected organs
- Heart: ST/T wave abnormalities
- Kidney: [[AKI.canvas|AKI]] 
- Pancreas: [[Notes/Pancreatitis|Pancreatitis]] 
- Liver: [[Acute liver failure]] 

### Clinical presentation
| Stages   | Time       | Symptoms                                                       | Signs                                                  | Laboratory findings                      |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Stage 1  | <12-24 h   | Nausea, vomiting, Diaphoresis, Anorexia                        | Pallor                                                 | Normal LFTs                              |
| Stage 2  | 24-72 h    | Apparent clinical improvement, Pain abdomen                    | Tachycardia, hypotension                               | LFT starts to become deranged            |
| Stage 3  | 3-4 days   | [[Acute liver failure]], [[AKI.canvas\|AKI]], [[Pancreatitis]] | Hepatomegaly, Tenderness, Encephalopathy, coagulopathy | Peak of LFT derangement, Lactic acidosis |
| Stage 4  | 5-14 days  | Survival or death                                              | Full resolution or [[Multiorgan dysfunction]]          |                                          |
| Recovery | 3-6 months |                                                                |                                                        |                                          |

### Diagnostics
- Acetylcysteine is most effective at preventing liver injury if started within eight hours of an acute ingestion; however, acetylcysteine provides benefit at any time after ingestion, even if there is no acetaminophen still present in serum.
- [[Rumack-Matthew nomogram]] interprets Concentration in relation to time after ingestion, and is predictive of [[Hepatotoxicity]] effect after single, acute ingestion
- Best laboratory guide for [[Notes/Hyperammonemia]] severity is [[Prothrombin time]] 
- [[Hyperphosphatemia]] 
- Rapid Acetaminophen assay
- [[RFT]]
- [[Glucose monitoring]]
- [[Ammonia]] levels 

### Treatment
- Decrease further exposure: [[Gastric lavage]]
- Improve metabolism: 
	- [[N-acetyl cysteine]] 
	- [[Methionine]] 
- Improve elimination 
	- [[Exchange Transfusion]] 
	- [[Arteriovenous hemofiltration]] for associated [[Excalidraw/Hyperammonemia|Hyperammonemia]]  
	- [[Hemodialysis]]: In a patient with a serum acetaminophen concentration â‰¥900 mcg/mL (5960 micromol/L) and altered mental status or metabolic acidosis, we suggest hemodialysis in addition to acetylcysteine
- [[Supportive measures]] 
	- Vitamin K for elevated PT (1.5x)
	- FFT for severe prolongation (3x normal)
	- [[PPI]] to prevent GI bleeding
	- Hepatic encephalopathy management
	- [[Cerebral edema]] management 
- [[Liver transplantation]]
