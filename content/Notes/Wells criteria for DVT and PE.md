| -------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| DVT symptoms                                       | 3     |
| PE likely than other diagnosis                     | 3     |
| Previous PE/DVT                                    | 1.5   |

	- Total score 0–1: low probability of PE (6%)
	- Total score 2–6: intermediate probability of PE (23%)
