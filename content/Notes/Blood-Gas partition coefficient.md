- Measure of Blood solubility
- BGPC= dissolved concentration/freed concentration
- Ratio of Blood and Alveolar concentrations when diffusion has completed
- Time taken more as it increases 
- Speed of induction/recovery ‚àù 1/blood solubility 
- Less soluble is the gas in blood, faster it reaches the brain tissue to induce anesthesia
- Affects onset of action and recovery time
- [[Brain-blood partition coefficient]]
