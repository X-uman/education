Neurosyphilis presents a complex clinical picture, with manifestations ranging from acute meningitis to chronic progressive neurological disorders. Here's a breakdown of its features:

- **Definition**: Infection with treponemal invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), affecting the meninges, cerebral vasculature, and/or parenchyma.
- **Epidemiology**: Can occur at any stage of infection, with approximately 0.8% of infected individuals with early syphilis affected. It's more common in states of immunosuppression, such as coinfection with HIV.
- **Clinical Features**: Highly variable and may include:
	  - Acute syphilitic meningitis (e.g., neck stiffness, nausea)
	  - Subacute stroke, meningitis, and/or cranial nerve disorders
	  - Paretic neurosyphilis: Chronic, progressive meningoencephalitis leading to widespread cerebral atrophy and major neurocognitive disorder. Early manifestations include personality changes, deficits of memory, and judgment.
	  - Neurologic symptoms like dysarthria, hypotonia, tremors
	  - Argyll Robertson pupil: Bilateral miosis where pupils accommodate but do not react to light.
	  - [[Tabes dorsalis]] (syphilitic myelopathy)
- **Diagnostics**: CSF studies with supportive findings including:
	  - Reactive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL)
	  - Lymphocytic pleocytosis (HIV negative: >5 WBC/mm3, HIV positive: >20 WBC/mm3)
	  - Elevated protein
	  - Positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test
- **Treatment**: Penicillin is the mainstay of treatment. See "Treatment of syphilis" for details.
