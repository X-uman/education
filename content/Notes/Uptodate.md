I am writing to express my sincere interest in obtaining an UpToDate subscription through your donations program. As a healthcare provider deeply committed to delivering high-quality patient care, I believe that access to UpToDate would significantly enhance my clinical practice and ultimately benefit the patients I serve.

The setup and funding structure of our hospital primarily rely on government grants and donations. And as a newly joining intern, their pay is barely sufficient for me to pay even rent and food. Nepal has one of the lowest salary for doctors. I get NR 10,000 per MONTH (US $120.64) as an intern. With inflation at all time high, politics being unstable, even affording a decent book is difficult, frankly speaking. I have been working just for the sake of my satisfaction otherwise I would leave this field because of horrid pay and no respect for doctors in our country. I can't even pay sufficiently for my single life properly nowadays. Therefore, your donations program presents a valuable opportunity for me to access this invaluable tool without straining my limited resources. 

Manipal hospital primarily serves patients from rural areas. Many of our patients face socioeconomic challenges and rely on us for affordable or subsidized healthcare services. Most of our patients are farmers, laborers and people of lower economic background. The hospital was made by Indian government in collaboration with Nepalese government to serve the people of the region. It has tertiary health care facilities and serves a large population in the region. However, there is no proper system where hospital provides subscriptions, resources or services for medical students or doctors. Even the library does not have updated books. We have to rely on older editions to get knowledge, if we go to library. It looks like 20th century library. Most of the information which I got was from google during my medical school. It's inconvenient here, to say the least. 

The field of medicine progresses at a rapid pace, with new research, guidelines, and treatment modalities emerging almost daily. In this dynamic environment, staying abreast of the latest advancements is not just desirableâ€”it's essential. In the bustling corridors of our healthcare facility, where every moment counts and every decision carries weight, I stand at the front lines of patient care as a intern. It's a role I embrace with passion and dedication. And your support in this endeavor will be highly appreciated. 
Sincerely.
