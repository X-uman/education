### Introduction
- [[Segmental demyelinating neuropathy]] 
- [[Polyradiculopathy]] 
 - [[Polyneuropathy]] 
#### Causes 
- [[Campylobacter jejuni]] 
- [[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]
- [[CMV]], [[EBV]], [[HIV]], [[Zika virus]] 
- [[Influenza virus]] vaccine 
### Pathophysiology
- [[Blood brain barrier]] 
- [[Molecular mimicry]] 
	- [[Gangliosides]] 
	- [[Schwann cells]] 
	- [[Nerve fibers]] infiltration by [[Lymphocytes]] 
### Findings 
- Sensory, motor, autonomic and Cognitive manifestations 
- Ascending [[LMN Lesions]] reaching up to [[cranial nerves]]
- symptoms recede in reverse order of their development
- [[Sensory neuropathy]] 
- [[Autonomic neuropathy]] 
- [[Motor neuropathy]] 

### Diagnostics 
- in [[CSF Analysis]] 
	- ==Albumino-cytological dissociation==
	- CSF protein may be normal in first 10 d
	- No increase in CSF WBC count
- [[Nerve conduction studies]] 
- [[Electromyography]] 
- [[Gangliosides]] GM1 Antibody found in ~ 25% 
- MRI: 
	- Consider in patients with abrupt paralysis and urinary retention to rule out spinal cause 
	- Nerve root enhancement is seen

### Management
- High dose [[IV Immunoglobulins]]
	- 0.4 g/kg daily infusion for 5 d
	- Commence within 2 week of first symptom
	- Look for allergic reactions due to IgG antibodies in IgA deficiency patient 
- [[Plasmapheresis]] 
- [[Glucocorticoids]] contraindicated, may have even worse outcome except [[Chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy]] where they are effective 
- [[gabapentin]] can be used for [[Neuropathic pain]] 
- Supportive treatment for neuropathic symptoms

### Complications
- Rapid spread of paralysis leading to decompensation of [[Vitals]] 
	- [[Respiratory failure]] find by [[Pulmonary function tests]] 
	- [[Arrhythmias]]
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism]] 

### Prognosis
- Death can occur as many as > 30 days after onset of symptoms, during the recovery phase.

### related
- [[Multiple Sclerosis]] but distal to [[Anterior horn]] 
- [[Botulism]] but the paralysis is Ascending 
- [[Rigor mortis]] but only resolution is descending 
- [[Transverse myelitis]] where both UL & LL are equally affected, not common in children? 
- [[Borreliosis]] 
- [[Compressive myelopathy]] 
- [[Miller-Fisher syndrome]]
