### Definition
- Epithelial crowding that displaces stroma to a point at which stromal volume is less than approximately half of total tissue volume in non-secretory endometrium, and typically cells appear morphologically clonal and distinct from the surrounding endometrium. 
- In the EIN system, the D-score is a measure of stromal volume as a proportion of total tissue volume (stroma + epithelium + gland lumen). 
- EIN is distinguished from BEH by the presence of glandular crowding, even without atypia. 
- Thus, both BEH and EIN have some overlap with WHO categories without atypia.
- Very high risk of endometrial carcinoma
- Incidence of coexisting invasive endometrial carcinoma is reported to be up to 40%
