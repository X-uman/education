### Fluid resuscitation
- 2 large bore Cannula proximally placed
- Blood taken for cross matching
- Balanced crystalloid (e.g., Ringer's lactate) is less likely than normal saline to cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in large volumes. 
- Colloids are no better than crystalloids during initial resuscitation. 
- For patients in hemorrhagic shock, crystalloids should only be considered a temporizing measure until blood products are available. 
- The 2021 ACEP Task Force recommends titration based on frequent fluid response assessments rather than a fixed weight-based fluid bolus. 
- Exercise caution with volume resuscitation in the absence of massive ongoing bleeding or hemorrhagic shock, especially if the source of hemorrhage is inadequately controlled. Aggressive crystalloid and blood product administration in these patients can increase the risk of rebleeding and death.

### Clearly apparent hypovolemia: Aggressively replace volume deficit.
- IV fluid bolus over 10–30 minutes (using glucose-free isotonic crystalloids)
	- Adults: NS or lactated Ringer's 500–1000 mL IV bolus 
	- Children: NS or lactated Ringer's 10–20 mL/kg IV bolus
	- Repeat as needed based on individual hemodynamic monitoring parameters. E.g., adults with sepsis often require up to 30 mL/kg within the first hour of presentation. 
- Hemorrhagic shock: Prioritize blood transfusion as soon as it is available (replace blood losses with blood products).

### Uncertain hypovolemia or high-risk patients: includes patients with risk factors for fluid overload or clinical signs of hypervolemia
- Assess fluid responsiveness, e.g., perform a fluid challenge or a passive leg raise . 
- Fluid responsive: Repeat [[Fluid Challenge Test]] until there is no longer a response.
- No response to IV fluids: Stop IV fluid boluses; start vasopressors or inotropes.

### After stabilization
- Continue with volume titration; further fluid challenges can be performed.
- Proceed with other strategies for IV fluid therapy according to the patient's needs.
