- Virus Initiated, not self-perpetuating–Self-limited

### Pathology
- Gross: Unilaterally/Bilaterally Enlarged, Firm, Intact Capsule, Slightly adherent to surrounding tissue
- CS: Firm yellow white–Affected area
- Micro: Patchy changes
	- Early–Scattered follicles, disrupted, replaced By Neutrophils, micro-abscesses
	- Later–Granuloma––L, M, P Aggregated Follicles–Disrupted–colloid leaked out, Foreign body Multinucleated Giant cells–contain the colloid
	- Later–Chronic Inflammation + Fibrosis
	- Different Stages sometimes found the same gland

### Clinical presentation
- Pain in the thyroid area, enlargement, Tenderness
- Sudden or gradual, radiate to U neck, Jaw, Throat, ear, particularly when swallowing
