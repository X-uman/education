### Introduction 
- Amber colored serous fluid ([[Cholesterol]]) collection between two layers of Tunica Vaginalis
### Presentation
- ==Transillumination== test is positive
	- Negative transillumination happens when there is blood, pus, tumor, or thickened wall of the hydrocele
- Fluctuation test positive
- Getting above swelling possible
- dullness to percussion

### Classification
| **Type**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Idiopathic**              | Most common form of hydrocele; cause unknown                                                                                                                          |
| **Congenital hydrocele**    | Occurs due to the failed closure of the processus vaginalis during development; typically seen in infancy                                                             |
| -Communicating hydrocele    | Results from an open connection between the peritoneal cavity and the scrotum, hydrocele disappears when the patient's lower body is elevated and comes back on again |
| -Noncommunicating hydrocele | Develops without a connection to the peritoneal cavity                                                                                                                |
| **Acquired hydrocele**      | Develops secondary to underlying pathology such as trauma, tumor, torsion, or infection                                                                               |
| - [[Filariasis]]            | Most common cause worldwide, primarily associated with lymphatic filariasis, rare in the US                                                                           |
- Primary Hydrocele: Testis not palpable separately unlike Secondary
- Congenital Hydrocele: Inverted ink bottle effect: Patient lying down for long time, size of hydrocele reduces, and vice versa
- Encysted hydrocele: Decreased on pulling testis

### Complications
- [[Pyocele]] 
- [[Hematocele]] due to Trypsinogen 
- Rupture not seen, even when elephant stands according to some books

### Management: always needs surgery
| **Type of Surgery** | **Description**                                                                                                                  |                                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lord's Plication    | Incision and drainage of the hydrocele followed by plication of the tunica vaginalis to prevent fluid re-accumulation;           | suitable for small hydroceles with thin sacs                                  |
| Jaboulay's Eversion | Open surgery involving the eversion of the tunica vaginalis sac and scrotal lymphatic absorption;                                | suitable for large hydroceles                                                 |
| Hydrocelectomy      | Surgical removal of the hydrocele sac, either through open surgery or minimally invasive techniques                              |                                                                               |
| [[Sclerotherapy]]   | Injection of a sclerosing agent into the hydrocele sac to cause scarring and closure, often performed as an outpatient procedure |                                                                               |
| Excision            | Surgical removal of the hydrocele sac                                                                                            | particularly indicated for cases of thick sacs, hematoceles, or infected sacs |
| Marsupialization    | Creation of a permanent opening in the hydrocele sac to allow drainage into surrounding tissues                                  |                                                                               |
