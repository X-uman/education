### Normal growth
- Findings after 48 hours
- The expected percentage increase in β-hCG for normal IUPs is determined based on the initial level.
   - Initial level < 1500 mIU/mL: > 49% expected increase
   - Initial level 1500–3000 mIU/mL: > 40% expected increase
   - Initial level > 3000 mIU/mL: > 33% expected increase

- In a normal pregnancy, the β-HCG level doubles every 48-72 hours until it reaches 10,000-20,000mIU/mL.
- Falling β-hCG levels may indicate a failed IUP (e.g., spontaneous abortion) or an ectopic pregnancy.
- An insufficient decline in serial β-hCG measurements following induced abortion should raise suspicion for ectopic pregnancy

### Follow up in Hytatidiform mole
- Follow up weekly till 3 consecutive levels are negative (usually becomes negative in 1-2 months) 
- In our practice, we consider disease remission as three consecutive weekly normal hCG values (less than 5 mIU/mL).
- After negative, monthly for 6 months
- Follow up for 1 year after it normalizes  
- Patient should avoid pregnancy 
	- [[IUCD]] contraindicated
	- [[Hormonal contraceptives]] are advised
