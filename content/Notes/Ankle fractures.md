Here's a tabulated breakdown of the fractures around the ankle joint:

| Fracture Type        | Definition                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Pilon Fracture]]   | Involves the distal tibia, extending into the weight-bearing surface of the tibial plafond. |
| [[Talus fractures]]  | Involves fractures of the talus bone, which is a key component of the ankle joint.          |
| Calcaneal Fracture   | Involves fractures of the calcaneus, or heel bone.                                          |
- Conservative management: Casting or bracing for stable fractures.
- Surgical intervention: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or talar fusion for complex fractures.
- Rehabilitation: Physical therapy.
