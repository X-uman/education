### Definition
- Meconium ileus refers to the failure to pass the first stool in neonates, which typically occurs within the first 24-48 hours after birth.

### Causes
- Cystic fibrosis is the cause in more than 90% of cases.

### Clinical Presentation
- Signs of distal small bowel obstruction:
    - Bilious vomiting
    - Abdominal distention
    - Absence of passing meconium or stool

### Diagnosis
- X-ray abdomen with contrast agent:
- Dilated small bowel loops
- Microcolon: narrow caliber of the colon due to the lack of passage of meconium
- Neuhauser sign (soap bubble appearance): mottled or bubble-like appearance in the distal ileum and/or cecum due to meconium mixing with swallowed air
- Air-fluid levels are uncommon due to the viscous consistency of meconium.

### Management
- **Enema with a contrast agent**Â (osmotic action helps relieve symptoms)
    - Mypaque enema: Hyposmolar enema
    - Gastrograffin enema: Hyperosmolar enema
- **Surgery:**
    - Bishop Hoop Operation: Chimney-shaped ileostomy (rarely performed)
### Complications
- Perforations leading to Meconium Peritonitis
