- Immune complex-mediated [[small vessel vasculitis]] can be seen in 
	- rheumatoid arthritis, 
	- systemic lupus erythematosus, 
	- Sjogren syndrome, 
	- Henoch-Schönlein purpura, 
	- cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, 
	- Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, 
	- Erythema elevatum diutinum, and 
	- cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, formerly known as hypersensitivity vasculitis.  

- Other causes of small vessel vasculitis or leukocytoclastic vasculitis include drug-induced vasculitis, paraneoplastic vasculitis, and infection associated vasculitis (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis).

- Key clinical features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis include palpable purpura on the lower extremity, small vessel involvement, and, in about 30 percent of individuals, extracutaneous involvement

- small vessel vasculitis characterized histopathologically by immune complex-mediated vasculitis of the dermal capillaries and venules

- Turbulence and increased venous pressure present in the lower extremities can elucidate why leukocytoclastic vasculitis commonly tends to occur on the legs

- Direct immunofluorescence may show according to disease 
	- strong IgA deposition without other antibody deposition

- reverse koebnerization has been described with the disappearance of the lesions with pressure bandage application after the biopsy
