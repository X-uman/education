### Introduction
- Aka Follicular cyst
- Enlargement of space where un-erupted/impacted teeth are lying
- Lined  by reduced [[Enamel]] Epithelium consisting of 2-3 layers to flat or cuboidal cells attached to the teeth at cemento-enamel junction. 
- Non-keratinized epithelium 
- **Cyst content: Yellowish fluid due to [[Cholesterol]] crystals
### Clinical Features
- M > F
- Missing tooth: un-erupted teeth are lying in the [[cyst]]
- [[Space Occupying Lesion]],
	- Expansion of cortical plates: **Egg shell Crackling**
	- Root resorption, loosening of adjacent tooth
	- [[Malocclusion]] 
	- Ill fitting dentures
	- Facial deformity
	- Nasal obstruction, chronic sinusitis 
	- [[Pathological fractures]] 
- Painless unless Infected
- 75% of all cases are located in the mandible on 3rd molar
- Second commonest location: maxillary canine 

### Investigations
##### Radiology
- Unilocular cyst containing unerupted tooth
- Cystic space surrounds the crown but does not involve the roots.
- Displacement, and root resorption of adjacent teeth: Loosening of teeth?
1. Central variant
    - This is the most common variant which the cyst surrounds the crown of the tooth and the crown projects into the cyst.
2. Lateral variant
    - This variant is usually associated with a mesioangular impacted mandibular third molar that is partially erupted. The cyst develops laterally along the root surface and partially surrounds the crown.
3. Circumferential variant
    - The cyst surrounds the crown and extends for some distance along the root surface so that a significant portion of the root appears to lie within the cyst, as if the tooth was erupting through the centre of the cyst.
- Radiographically, dentigerous cysts may resemble other radiolucencies such as [[Odontogenic keratocyst]] or unicystic ameloblastomas, necessitating histopathological evaluation for definitive diagnosis.
### Treatment
- [[Treatment of cyst]] 
- Infection: Aspiration of pus
### Complications
- [[Pathological fractures]]: if large enough
- very rarely dentigerous cysts may develop into mural [[ameloblastoma]] 
- there is a potential for development of squamous cell carcinoma in the context of chronic infection
