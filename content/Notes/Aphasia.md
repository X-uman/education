- Poor repetition, 
	- Neither speak fluently nor repeat but comprehend, write, preserved insight, agrammatism:[[Broca's area]] 
	- Can speak but does not comprehend nor repeat, jargon, neologism:[[Wernicke's area]] 
	- Neither speak nor comprehend, both areas involved
	- Only impaired repetition: only [[Arcuate fasciculus]] involved aka Conduction aphasia
- Good repetition: [[Transcortical aphasia]]
