Arise from [[Enterochromaffin-like cells]] or Argentaffin cells or Kulchisky cells
#MCS is Bronchus, then [[Appendix]] then Ileum

#Sites and #commonest [[paraneoplastic syndrome]] 
	Foregut (Bronchus/Esophagus): mainly [[ACTH]] production and [[Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome)]]
	Midgut (Stomach/Small intestine/2:3 of colon): [[Serotonin]], [[Histamine]], [[Tryptophan]]
	production and [[Carcinoid syndrome]]
	Hindgut(Distal colon and rectum): [[Somatostatin]] and [[Peptide Y]] production

#types 
	==Primary==: No liver metastasis, products of tumor such as Serotonin, Histamine metabolized by liver and 5-Hydroxy Indole acetic acid which is inactive product
		#Presentation Abdominal pain, Diarrhea (Mainly asymptomatic)
	==Secondary==: With Liver [[Metastasis]]
		#Presentation Malignant [[Carcinoid syndrome]]

#associated #commonest with secondary [[Colonic cancers]]
[[MEN Syndrome]]: Multicentric tumors

#### Management
Any feasible type of [[Resection]] of both primary or secondary is advised to decrease the symptom
	Small bowel: Resection with 10cm margin
	[[Appendix]]: [[Appendectomy]]  or [[Colectomies]] depending upon location, size and spread
	Liver metastasis: [[Resection]] ( Carcinoids have Best #prognosis of all liver secondary)
	R1 or R2 Resection: Add ==Lanreotide==, ==Pasireotide== which is a long acting [[Somatostatin]] Analogue 
	#search SMART BOMB: Somatostatin containing Radiotherapy 'Radiolabelled Somatostatin Analogues'

### Prognosis Factors
Site: Ileal Metastasis > Appendix
Size: 
	<1cm: 10% Metastasis
	>1cm: 90%
Ki67 index: Low have low rate of metastasis
Grade of tumor
