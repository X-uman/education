### MOA
- Inhibits Complex I of [[Electron transport chain]] 
- decreases Hepatic [[Gluconeogenesis]] by decreasing cAMP levels by decreasing ATP:AMP ratio. (Opposes [[Glucagon]]): Lowers Fasting Glucose level with NO hypoglycemia
- reduces intestinal glucose absorption: reduced Post-prandial glucose, causes Anorexia 
- decreases [[Insulin resistance]]
- Reduces LDL, increases HDL: prevents [[Complications of DM]] 
- Enhances [[fatty acid oxidation]] 
- Promotes [[Anaerobic respiration]] in periphery by blocking ETC: [[Lactic acidosis]] production and inhibits its metabolism 

### ADRs
- Metallic taste
- [[Lactic acidosis]] accumulation in contraindicated groups
	- [[CKD]], [[Chronic liver disease]], [[Alcoholism]] 
	- [[Congestive Cardiac failure]]
	- Advanced age 
- Diarrhea, Dehydration 
- long term: [[Vitamin B12 deficiency]] by impairing [[Calcium]] homeostasis

### Interaction
- [[Sulphonylureas]]: increases CVS mortality
- [[cimetidine]], [[Furosemide]] compete with excretion 

### Uses
- DOC in [[Type 2 DM]]
- [[PCOS]] to improve [[Ovulation]]
