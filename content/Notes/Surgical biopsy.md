| [[Excisional biopsy]] | - Small lesions <1cm appearing benign<br>- Complete removal without mutilation possible                                     | - Complete removal of the lesion<br>- Including a perimeter of normal tissue (2-3 mm) with the specimen                                                                                                |
| [[Incisional biopsy]] | - Large lesion or multiple differing characteristics<br>- When hospitalization or complex wound management needed           | - Margins extending into normal tissue on skin surface<br>- Avoidance of necrotic tissue<br>- Deep enough to include underlying changes                                                                |
