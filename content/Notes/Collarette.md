- A collarette in dermatology refers to “a narrow rim of loosened keratin overhanging the periphery of a circumscribed skin lesion, attached to the normal surrounding skin.”
- The outer margin of the “collarette” is adherent while the inner margin is free. 
- In practice, however, the skin forming the collarette may be scaly (e.g., pityriasis rosea, keratolysis exfoliativa, etc.) or thick and ridge-like, forming a rim around the lesion (e.g., acral fibrokeratoma, viral warts, etc.).
