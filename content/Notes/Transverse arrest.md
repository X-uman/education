### Etiopathogenesis
- Transverse arrest is thought to result from 
	- constraint to rotation by the bony pelvis 
	- and/or inadequate power to induce rotation from contractions or maternal expulsive efforts
- Although transverse arrest can occur with any pelvic type, it is more common with the platypelloid (flat) or android pelvis (see [[Female pelvis]])
### Management

| Scenario                                        | Action                                                                 | Prerequisites/Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initial Stage                                   | Opt for expectant management over manual rotation.                     | Some descent over time. - Reassuring fetal heart rate pattern.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| OT Position Identified                          | Consider prophylactic rotation.                                        | - Potential harm with intervention.- Lack of strong evidence for improved outcomes with manual rotation.                                                                                                                                   |
| Expulsive Efforts                               | Monitor for spontaneous rotation.                                      | - Maternal expulsive efforts increase force on fetal head. - Ensure descent is continuing.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Progress Stops                                  | Assess need for manual rotation.                                       | - It is best to attempt the rotation soon after diagnosis of the arrest because it is more likely to be successful before the head becomes significantly impacted in pelvis.. - Risks of umbilical cord prolapse or fetal/maternal injury. |
| Descent Continues, Rotation Doesn't Occur       | Continue expectant management.                                         | - Monitor closely for further descent or spontaneous rotation.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Failed Manual Rotation                          | Consider vacuum- or forceps-assisted delivery.                         | - Prerequisites for vacuum or forceps delivery should be met.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Multiparous Patients with Low Transverse Arrest | Consider trial of vacuum extraction if manual rotation fails.          | - Prerequisites for vacuum extraction should be met. - Avoid actively rotating the vacuum cup to prevent fetal injury.                                                                                                                     |
| Nulliparous Patients or High Transverse Arrest  | Avoid trial of vacuum extraction due to high risk of failure.          | - Data from randomized trials or large cohort or case-control studies are not available.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Patients with Low Transverse Arrest             | Consider forceps rotation as second-line option after failed rotation. | - Standard prerequisites for forceps delivery should be met.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Patients with High Transverse Arrest            | Avoid forceps rotation; consider only under extreme circumstances.     | - Rare for physicians to have requisite experience for safe and effective forceps rotation. - Consider only under extreme circumstances.                                                                                                   |
- The process starts with the diagnosis of transverse arrest during labor.
- The first step is to attempt manual rotation if a clinician with expertise is available.
- If manual rotation is successful, proceed to delivery.
- If manual rotation fails, consider vacuum- or forceps-assisted delivery.
- For multiparous patients with low transverse arrest, a trial of vacuum extraction may be considered if manual rotation fails.
- If vacuum extraction is not suitable, consider forceps rotation if expertise is available.
- If forceps rotation is not possible or contraindicated, other delivery options should be considered.
