[[Scopy]] 

### Indications of complete colonoscopy 
- [[Lower GI Bleeding]]
- Recurrent Abdominal pain
- Recurrent diarrhea
- Malignancy suspected
- Follow up for colorectal cancer or polyp
- Screening for Family history of Colorectal Ca
- Inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis
- Rectal bleeding

- Chronic diarrhea after sigmoidoscopy/rectal
### Precautions
- Do not advance without clear view of lumen
- Do not advance if there is any resistance
- Pull back when in doubt
- Use as little air as possible and as much air as necessary
- Pay attention to patient's pain reaction

| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cardiopulmonary                              | - Transient Hypoxia, Bradycardia, Hypotension during the procedure with Propofol/midazolam                                                   |
| Perforation                                  | - May occur during movement, polypectomy, or due to barotrauma                                                                               |
| Hemorrhage                                   | - Risk factors include large polyp size, multiple polyps, histology of polyp, hypertension, coagulation disorders, warfarin, and aspirin use |
|                                              | - Hemorrhage can occur particularly during polypectomy                                                                                       |
|                                              | - Hot biopsy forceps are associated with increased risk of bleeding                                                                          |
| Post-polypectomy Electrocoagulation Syndrome | - Presents with fever, localized pain, peritoneal signs, leukocytosis, but CT shows no evidence of perforation                               |
|                                              | - Does not require surgery; treatment involves NBM (nil by mouth), IV hydration, and antibiotics                                             |
|                                              | - Caused by electrocoagulation injury to the bowel wall resulting in transmural burn                                                         |
| Infection                                    | - Can occur as a complication of endoscopic procedures                                                                                       |
| Gas explosion                                | - Can occur due to methane/hydrogen buildup in the colon, especially during electrosurgery                                                   |
|                                              | - Risk factors include lactulose use, incomplete bowel preparation, and enema use                                                            |
| Infective Endocarditis                       | - Antibiotic prophylaxis may be required to prevent infective endocarditis                                                                   |

### Prophylaxis for hemorrhage
- Clips
- Adrenaline injection
- Endoloop, RCT proven for pedunculated polyps
- Mini snare resection without electrocautery
