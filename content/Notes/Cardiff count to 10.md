The Cardiff "Count to 10" method is a simple way for pregnant women to monitor fetal movements to ensure the well-being of their baby. Here’s how it works:

### Cardiff "Count to 10" Method

1. **Start counting fetal movements at the same time each day.** Usually, it is recommended to choose a time when the baby is typically active.
2. **Lie down or sit in a comfortable position.** It’s often easier to feel the movements when lying on your side.
3. **Count each movement you feel.** This includes kicks, rolls, swishes, or flutters. 
4. **Note the time it takes to reach 10 movements.** 

#### Guidelines:
- Ideally, you should feel at least 10 movements within a 12-hour period.
- Many women feel 10 movements much sooner, often within 1-2 hours.
### When to Seek Medical Advice:
- If you do not feel 10 movements within 12 hours.
- If there is a significant change in the pattern of movements.
- If you notice a sudden decrease in fetal movements.

Monitoring fetal movements using the Cardiff "Count to 10" method helps in early detection of potential problems, allowing for timely medical intervention if necessary.
