### Introduction
- A type of soft tissue cyst associated with the eruption of a tooth through the gingiva.
- Commonly observed in pediatric dentistry practice.
- Develops when a tooth erupts and puts pressure on the overlying soft tissue.
- The pressure leads to accumulation of fluid between the tooth and the gingiva, forming a cystic lesion.
### Presentation
- Presents as a bluish-purple swelling overlying the erupting tooth.
- May exhibit a translucent appearance due to the fluid-filled nature of the cyst.
- Usually painless unless associated with trauma or infection.
- Commonest site: Anterior to 1st Permanent Molars

### Management
- Generally, no treatment is required as eruption cysts often resolve spontaneously.
- Gentle pressure or aspiration may be performed to facilitate eruption and relieve discomfort if necessary.
- If the cyst persists or becomes symptomatic, surgical intervention such as excision may be considered.
