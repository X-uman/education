### Types
- [[Hemispheric syndromes]]
- [[Lacunar stroke]] 
- [[Posterior circulation syndromes]] 
- [[Basilar Stroke]] 
- [[Brainstem strokes]] 

### Presentation
- Acute onset of [[Focal neurological deficits]] 
- corresponding to Vascular territories. See [[Blood Supply of Brain]] 

### Localization by CF
- Hemiparesis with IL [[Cranial nerves]] Palsy: Brain lesion
- Hemiparesis with CL CN Palsy: Brainstem lesion
- UMN Lesion with Abnormal sensation: Likely [[Spinal Lesions]]
- [[Horner Syndrome]] ?

### Examination
- [[NIHSS Score]]: 0-42 
- [[Sriraj Stroke Score]] 
- [[Oxfordshire Stroke Classification]] 
- Carotid artery pulsation 
### Diagnostics
- R/o [[Atrial fibrillation]], [[Myocardial infarction]] and [[Hypoglycemia]] in ER
- Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia detrimental for stroke also
- [[CT-scan]] to Rule out Hemorrhage, Hemorrhagic Transformation, Candidacy for Revascularization: [[ASPECTS Score]] 
- Most sensitive: [[Diffusion Weighed Imaging]] shows Hyper-intensity and Hypo-intensity in ADC but MRI takes time to be done. 
- Lumbar puncture if [[Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage]] suspected but CT is equivocal 
### Management
- [[Neurological emergency]]: Activate Stroke Units without delay
	- [[Ischemic Stroke]]
	- [[Hemorrhagic Stroke]] 
- [[Reperfusion therapy]]  
- institute antihypertensive therapy only for patients with a systolic blood pressure > 220/130 mmHg: 
	- [[Blood pressure targets in stroke]] 
	- [[BP control before reperfusion in stroke.png]]
