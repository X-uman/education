### Etiology
- Herpes Virus 7 
- Sometimes type 6 also 
### Presentation
- Affects 10-35 years old people
- First lesion: appears in trunk, aka Herald patch
	- Annular papule with Salmon-pink center
	- Collarette Scaling at periphery (The outer margin of the “collarette” is adherent while the inner margin is free)
- Subsequent lesions appear in trunk with Christmas/Fir tree distribution - Follow skin cleavage lines with long axis of oval along the lines
- [[Collarette scaling]] is a characteristic sign in pityriasis rosea. The scaling appears as a collarette and characteristically lags behind the outer erythematous edge of the patch – “trailing scale” or the “hanging curtain sign”

### Management
##### Pharmacological
- Oral anti-histamines and Topical Steroids can be used to reduce itching
- A 2007 meta-analysis concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of most treatments
- Oral Erythromycin was found to be effective for treating the rash and relieving the itch based on one early trial; however, a later study could not confirm these results.
- Oral Acyclovir may reduce the duration of symptoms

##### Non-pharmacological
- Irritants such as soaps with fragrances, hot water, wool, and synthetic fabrics should be avoided.
- Direct sunlight makes the lesions resolve more quickly.
- UV therapy is most beneficial in the first week of the eruption
