### Etiologies
- Previous mid-trimester [[pregnancy loss]] and/or preterm birth
- Previous obstetric or gynecological trauma (e.g., termination of pregnancy, rapid delivery, multiple gestations, or cervical conization)
- [[Short cervical length]]: transvaginal cervical length < 25 mm on ultrasound before 24 weeks' gestation 
- Cervical connective tissue weakness (e.g., [[Ehler-Danlos syndrome]])
- [[Diethylstilbestrol]] exposure: Cockscomb cervix 

### Clinical features
- Painless cervical dilation with or without prolapsed membranes
- Nonspecific findings
	- Pelvic cramps or backache 
	- ↑ Volume, changed color (yellow or blood-stained), and/or thinner consistency of vaginal discharge
### Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis typically before 24 weeks' (may be up to 28 weeks') gestation  (After 28 weeks the cervix naturally begins to shorten.) OR 
	- History of ≥ 2 previous mid-trimester [[Pregnancy loss]] 
	- or  ≥ 3 [[Preterm labor]] 
	- not explained by any other cause, 
	- and a short cervical length on transvaginal ultrasound before 24 weeks' gestation
- Maybe detected on screening for short cervical length.
- Cervical resistance index
- USG or premenstrual Hysterography
### Management
- In women with risk factors, serial USG monitoring between 16–24 weeks' gestation 
- [[Cervical cerclage]] (Macdonald suture) done before 24 WOG (most commonly at 13-16 weeks)
- Management of [[Short cervical length]]
- Strict bed rest is not recommended
