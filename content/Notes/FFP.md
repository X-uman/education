### Indications
- Bleeding or expected bleeding (eg, emergency surgery) in individuals with deficiencies of multiple coagulation factors (eg, DIC, liver disease, massive transfusion, anticoagulation with warfarin or warfarin overdose if not corrected by vitamin K and/or PCC, depending on the clinical setting).
- Bleeding in individuals with isolated factor deficiencies (most often factor V) if a factor concentrate or recombinant factor is not available.
- Therapeutic plasma exchange in [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura]] (as a source of ADAMTS13).
- In the rare event that FFP is used to replace a clotting factor, the dose is 10 to 20 mL/kg. This dose will raise the level of any factor, including fibrinogen, by close to 30%, which is typically sufficient for hemostasis.
