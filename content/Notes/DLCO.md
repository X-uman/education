**Test Procedure**:
- The patient inhales a small, controlled amount of carbon monoxide (CO) mixed with a trace gas, usually helium or methane. The patient holds their breath for about 10 seconds to allow the CO to diffuse into the bloodstream.
- After holding their breath, the patient exhales slowly and completely into a mouthpiece connected to the testing machine.
- The DLCO machine measures the concentration of CO in the exhaled breath to determine how much CO was taken up during the breath-holding period.
- DLCO is often reported as the volume of CO that diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane per minute per millimeter of mercury pressure difference (ml/min/mmHg). This measurement is then adjusted for factors such as hemoglobin levels and lung volume.

- **Va:** number of contributing alveolar units measured by tracer gas (helium)
- **Kco:** CO transfer coefficient, usually written as  **DLCO/Va,** which indicates the efficiency of CO transfer by alveoli.
	- KCo may be raised in conditions involving profuse pulmonary hemorrhage
