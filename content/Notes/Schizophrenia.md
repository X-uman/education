Feels like ghosts stalking you

- [[Psychotic vs Neurotic disorders]] 
- [[Cognitive functions]] are usually maintained 
- Psychotic disorder of thought, feeling and activity 
	- [[Stream of thought]]
	- [[Thought content or perception]] 
	- [[Emotion]] 
	- [[Abnormal behavior]]  
	- [[Personality]] 

### Epidemiology
- Genetic factors: risk significantly increased if relatives are also affected 
	   - One schizophrenic parent: ∼ 10%
	   - Two schizophrenic parents: ∼ 40%
	   - Concordance rate in monozygotic twins: 30–40%
	   - Concordance rate in dizygotic twins: 10–15%
- Environmental factors
	- Stress and psychosocial factors 
		- Childhood trauma 
	- Frequent use of cannabis during early teens (associated with increased incidence and worse course of positive symptoms) 
	- Urban birth and upbringing 
	- Advanced paternal age at conception 
	- Obstetric complications and [[Neurodevelopmental disorders]] 
	- Birth in winters and early spring, prenatal exposure to influenza and malnutrition in mother
	- Second generation of immigrants 
	- Drift down hypothesis: Degradation of Socioeconomic status in people with schizophrenia
	- Body type: Asthenic, athletic people are more vulnerable to develop schizophrenia whereas pyknic people are more likely to develop [[Bipolar disorder]] 

### Etiology and pathogenesis
- Neurotransmitter dysregulation
	- Dopamine dysregulation
	- Increased serotonergic activity
	- Decreased dendritic branching
	- Decreased glutamatergic activity 
- Genetic predisposition
	- High concordance in monozygotic twins
	- Family members with patients of [[Bipolar disorder]]
	- [[DiGeorge Syndrome]]: 30% develop schizophrenia
	- Candidate genes: DISC 1, COMT 
- Structural changes in brain
	- Reduced cortical grey matter
	- Enlarged ventricles
	- Decreased volume of hippocampus and amygdala
	- Hypoactivity of the frontal lobes and hyperactivity of the basal ganglia 
	- Decreased symmetry


### Clinical features
- 5 A's: Autism, Ambivalence, affective blunting, Loosening Association
- Accessory symptoms:
	- Hallucination, delusion, catatonic symptoms, speech disorders
- [[Schneider first rank symptoms]] #todo/revision 
![[Pasted image 20240123214603.png]] 
- Other symptoms
	- [[Cognitive functions]] 
		- Inattention
		- Impaired memory
		- Poor executive functioning
	- Mood symptoms and anxiety
		- Mostly depression
	- Sensory disturbances and impaired coordination
	- Metabolic: Hypertension, DM, hyperlipidemia 

### Diagnostics
 DSM-5 diagnostic criteria
- At least two of the following symptoms must be present, with at least one of these from the first three symptoms listed:
	   - Delusions
	   - Hallucinations
	   - Disorganized speech/thought
	   - Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
	   - Negative symptoms
- The above symptoms persist for ≥ 1 month.
- There are continuous cognitive or affective disturbances for **≥ 6 months**.
- Symptoms must cause social, occupational, or personal functional **impairment** lasting ≥ 6 months.
- [[Schizoaffective disorder]] and [[Mood disorders]] with psychotic features have been ruled out.
- Medical or substance use disorder has been ruled out.
### Types of Schizophrenia  #obsolete 
- Paranoid: 
	- Delusion of persecution
	- most common type
	- Late onset, so good prognosis 
	- Usually able to maintain personality, social interaction
- [[Catatonia]]
	- Disturbed movement / statue
	- Best prognosis 
	- DOC: IV Lorazepam
	- [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] 
- Hebephrenic/disorganized: 
	- Giggling adolescent, inappropriate mood , no hallucinations
	- Early onset
	- Disorganized behavior
	- Severely Deteriorated personality 
	- Bad prognosis 
- Simple: 
	- Only [[Negative symptoms]] 
	- Patient needs to be observed for  1 y
	- Only social withdrawal
	- Worst prognosis 
- Undifferentiated
- Residual: Predominantly negative symptoms after treatment (Post-schizophrenic depression can happen)

### Classification according to ICD-11
- Schizophrenia, first episode: treat for 2 years 
- Schizophrenia, second episode: at least 5 years 
- Continuous schizophrenia (> 1 y)
- Catatonia has been made a diagnostic entity with its causes 

### TJ crow classification
- Type 1: 
	- [[Positive symptoms]]
	- Acute onset, good response
	- No imaging findings
- Type 2
	- [[Negative symptoms]]
	- Gradual onset, poor response
	- Structural changes in brain
- Most patients have mixture of symptoms

### Management
- Psychosocial treatment
	- Establish [[Therapeutic alliance]] 
	- Manage [[Expressed emotions]] 
	- [[Assertive community treatment]] 
	- Supported employment
	- Token economy for desirable behavior 
	- Skills training 
	- [[Cognitive remediation therapy]]
- [[Antipsychotic drugs]] do not alter the course of disease 
	- [[Atypical antipsychotics]] for [[Negative symptoms]] additionally
	- [[Typical antipsychotics]] for [[Positive symptoms]] 

### Prognosis
- Good prognosis
	- Late onset (> 45 y, females), first episode
	- Acute onset (< 2 weeks duration) , short duration
	- Precipitating stressor
	- Catatonic subtype
	- Presence of  affective symptoms like [[Mood disorders]] 
	- Family history of mood disorder
	- Female, Pyknic physique 
- Suicide rate: 5-6%
	- Attempt: 20%
	- MCC of unnatural and premature death
	- Risk factor: associated depression
		- increased symptom like command hallucinations, delusion of persecution
		- Early in course of illness, immediately after admission or discharge
		- young males, comorbid substance abuse, unemployed
		- At times, paradoxically in patient with less negative symptoms, less affective blunting
- [[Post-schizophrenic depression]] 
	- Moderate to severe 
	- Increased risk of suicide
