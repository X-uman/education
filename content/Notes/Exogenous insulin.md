- Insulin Glargine–Soluble in acidic pH, precipitate in normal body pH and slowly enter the circulation, Delayed but peak less effect, slow acting, aka Peak less Insulin, Acidic–so don not mix with other types of Insulin which are basic, others can be mixed with each other but not with Glargine-- i.e. given alone
