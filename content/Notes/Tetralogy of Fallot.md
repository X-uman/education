### Etiology
- Typically sporadic 
- Associated with the following genetic disorders:
	- [[Di-George syndrome ]]
	- Down syndrome 
- Maternal exposures during pregnancy
	- Alcohol
	- [[Phenylketonuria]] 
	- [[Gestational diabetes mellitus]]

### Presentation
- Depends upon severity of RV outflow obstruction
- [[Tet spells]] 
- Squatting (increased peripheral vascular resistance) decreases R-L shunting and improves symptoms

### Diagnostics
- A 'boot-shaped' heart ("cœur en sabot" in French) is the description given to the appearance of the heart on plain film in some cases of Tetralogy of Fallot. 
- It describes the appearances of an upturned cardiac apex due to right ventricular hypertrophy and a concave pulmonary arterial segment
### Management
- [[Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt]]
- Balloon dilatation of the pulmonary valve or stent of the patent arterial duct if present
