- Most sensitive and specific study for HFpEF confirmation, but expensive and invasive [20]
- Used to assess right heart function and pulmonary vascular resistance in patients being considered for mechanical circulatory support or heart transplant
- May be considered for monitoring and guiding management in certain patients with cardiogenic shock. SvO2 is low in decompensated HF.
