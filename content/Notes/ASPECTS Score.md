The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a 10-point quantitative topographic CT scan score used to assess early ischemic changes in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. It is designed to provide a systematic and standardized way to evaluate the extent of early ischemic changes in the MCA territory on non-contrast CT scans.

### ASPECTS Scoring System

The MCA territory is divided into 10 regions, and each region is assigned 1 point. A normal scan receives a score of 10, and 1 point is subtracted for each region showing signs of early ischemic change (e.g., parenchymal hypodensity, loss of gray-white matter differentiation).
### Interpretation of ASPECTS
- **Score 10**: No evidence of early ischemic changes.
- **Score 0-7**: Indicates moderate to extensive ischemic changes.
- **Score 0-4**: Indicates severe ischemic changes, often associated with poor outcomes and may influence decisions regarding reperfusion therapies.

### ASPECTS Scoring Table

| **Region**            | **Description**                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Caudate nucleus**   | Basal ganglia region                             |
| **Lentiform nucleus** | Basal ganglia region                             |
| **Insula**            | Insular cortex                                   |
| **Internal capsule**  | White matter tract                               |
| **M1**                | Anterior MCA cortex (superior to insular ribbon) |
| **M2**                | MCA cortex lateral to insular ribbon (anterior)  |
| **M3**                | MCA cortex posterior to M2                       |
| **M4**                | MCA cortex (anterior region superior to M1)      |
| **M5**                | MCA cortex (lateral region superior to M2)       |
| **M6**                | MCA cortex (posterior region superior to M3)     |

### Use of ASPECTS in Clinical Practice

The ASPECTS score is useful in assessing the extent of early ischemic changes and can help guide treatment decisions, particularly regarding the administration of thrombolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy. It is used in combination with clinical assessment and other imaging findings to provide a comprehensive evaluation of stroke severity and prognosis.
