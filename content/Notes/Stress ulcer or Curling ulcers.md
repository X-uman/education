### Pathophysiology
- Caused by decreased plasma volume (hypovolemia), which leads to a decline in gastric blood flow that weakens the mucosal barrier and causes mucosal ischemia.
- risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration of the gastric mucosa usually begins several hours after the initial insult (e.g., trauma, burn injury)
### Presentation
patients with a bleeding stress ulcer typically present with hematemesis, melena, and/or anemia as [[Upper GI-bleeding]] 

### Prophylaxis
