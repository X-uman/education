### British system
- CIN-1 represents less than one-third involvement of the thickness of epithelium (mild dysplasia).
- CIN-2 is one-third to two-third involvement (moderate dysplasia).
- CIN-3 is full-thickness involvement or equivalent to carcinoma in situ (severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ).

[[Bethesda system]]
	- L-SIL corresponds to CIN-1 and is a flat condyloma, having koilocytic atypia, usually related to HPV 6 and 11 infection (i.e. includes mild dysplasia and HPV infection).
	- H-SIL corresponds to CIN-2 and 3 and has abnormal pleomorphic atypical squamous cells. HPV 16 and 18 are implicated in the etiology of H-SIL (i.e. includes moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ).
