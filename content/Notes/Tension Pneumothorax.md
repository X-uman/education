- A tension pneumothorax arises when air in the pleural space builds up enough pressure to interfere with venous return, leading to hypotension, tachycardia and severe dyspnea
- Traditional teaching suggested that contralateral shift of the trachea and mediastinum, splaying of the ribs, and flattening of the ipsilateral diaphragm represent radiographic tension.
- A one-way valve mechanism is responsible for tension pneumothorax allowing gas to enter the pleural space during inspiration but not exit fully during expiration.
