### Pathophysiology
- Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle (including the interventricular septum) → ↓ ventricular relaxation → ↓ diastolic filling and systolic output → ↓ myocardial and peripheral perfusion
	- Decreased Myocardial perfusion, leads to [[Angina]], which is also seen in hypertrophy due to [[Aortic Stenosis]] 
- Obstructive type (HOCM): left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and mitral regurgitation due to systolic anterior movement (SAM) of the mitral valve
