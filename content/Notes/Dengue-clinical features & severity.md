The febrile phase is characterized by a sudden high-grade fever and dehydration typically lasting two to seven days. The critical phase is characterized by plasma leakage, bleeding, shock, and organ impairment; it usually starts around the time of defervescence (typically days 3 to 7 of infection) and lasts for 24 to 48 hours. The convalescent phase may be characterized by fatigue that can last for days to weeks.

### Severity grading
Here's a tabulated summary of the clinical classifications of Dengue infection:

| Clinical Classification      | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dengue without Warning Signs | - Residence in or travel to an endemic area <br> - Fever plus two of the following: <br>  • Nausea/vomiting <br>  • Rash <br>  • Headache, eye pain, muscle ache, or joint pain <br>  • Leukopenia <br>  • Positive [[tourniquet test]]                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Dengue with Warning Signs    | - Dengue infection plus any of the following: <br>  • Abdominal pain or tenderness <br>  • Persistent vomiting <br>  • Clinical fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion) <br>  • Mucosal bleeding <br>  • Lethargy or restlessness <br>  • Hepatomegaly >2 cm <br>  • Increase in hematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count                                                                    |
| Severe Dengue                | - Dengue infection with at least one of the following: <br>  • Severe plasma leakage leading to: <br>     - Shock <br>     - Fluid accumulation with respiratory distress <br>  • Severe bleeding (as evaluated by clinician) <br>  • Severe organ involvement: <br>     - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥1000 units/L <br>     - Impaired consciousness <br>     - Organ failure |
The World Health Organization has established the following grading system for severity of dengue hemorrhagic fever:
- DHF Grade I – Fever, hemorrhagic manifestation (positive tourniquet test), and evidence of plasma leakage.
- DHF Grade II – DHF Grade I plus spontaneous bleeding.
- DHF Grade III – DHF Grade I or DHF Grade II plus narrowing pulse pressure or hypotension.
- DHF Grade IV – DHF Grade III plus profound shock with undetectable blood pressure and pulse.
Dengue shock syndrome consists of DHF Grade III and DHF Grade IV.
