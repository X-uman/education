- Standard hemodynamic parameters do not adequately quantify the degree of physiologic derangement in trauma patients. 

| Variable                                              | Measurement                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Urine output]]                                      | best indicator of perfusion and resuscitation                                                                                                                              |
| [[Lactic acidosis]]                                   | Measured from blood samples using laboratory equipment.                                                                                                                    |
| Oxygen Delivery Parameters                            | Monitoring the time to normalization of base deficit, lactate, and pH is predictive <br>of survival, Supranormal oxygen delivery correlates with improved survival chances |
| Cardiac Output                                        | Measured using thermodilution or arterial pressure waveform analysis.                                                                                                      |
| Central Venous Pressure (CVP)                         | Measured using a central venous catheter, not as useful in cardiogenic and septic shock Due to change in ventricular compliance                                            |
| Invasive Arterial Blood Pressure                      | Measured using an arterial catheter.                                                                                                                                       |
| [[base deficit]]                                      | Calculated from arterial blood gas analysis.                                                                                                                               |
| Right Ventricular End Diastolic Volume Index (RVEDVI) | Better indicator of adequate volume resuscitation compared to CVP or PCWP.                                                                                                 |
### Indices
- [[Shock index]] 
- Modified shock index (MSI): HR/[[MAP]] is the most sensitive index
	- Low: Hyperdynamic
	- High: Hypodynamic: bad
- Rate over Pulse pressure evaluation (ROPE) = PR/PP (>3 is decompensated shock )
