### Definition
- Trauma induced coagulopathy is similar to DIC where the coagulation factors are exhausted in an attempt to minimize blood loss in traumatized tissue and this leads to coagulopathy. 
- Also acidosis and hypothermia from under perfusion leads to decreased function of coagulation proteases.
- [[Acidosis]] 
### Trauma-associated coagulopathy
- Is not truly disseminated (it exists at multiple sites of endothelial disruption)
- Is not truly intravascular (it is driven by extravascular tissue factor and subendothelial matrix collagen)
- Is not truly coagulation (it is bleeding)
- Is effectively treated with antifibrinolytic agents, which are contraindicated in true DIC
