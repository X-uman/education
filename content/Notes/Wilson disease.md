### effects of High Copper
- Liver
	- [[hepatitis]]
	- [[Chronic liver disease]]
	- [[cirrhosis]]
	- [[Portal Hypertension]] 
	- [[Acute liver failure]]
- Eyes
	- [[Kayser-Fleisher rings]]
	- Sunflower [[Cataract]]
- [[Basal nuclei]]
	- [[Parkinsonism]]
	- [[Dystonia]]
	- [[Tremors]] 
- [[Cerebellum]]: [[Cerebellar signs]] 
- [[Cerebrum]]: [[Cognitive functions]] impairment 
- Psychiatry
	- [[Depression]]
	- [[Psychotic disorders]] 
- [[Fanconi syndrome]] 

### Differential diagnoses

- Hepatic
   - [[Autoimmune hepatitis]]
   - [[Viral hepatitis]]
   - [[Hemochromatosis]]
   - [[NAFLD]]
   - [[Cirrhosis]]
- Neuropsychiatric
   - Parkinson disease
   - Huntington disease
   - [[Multiple sclerosis]]
   - [[Schizophrenia]]
   - [[Personality disorders]] 


## Diagnosis
- Suspected in cases of nonspecific noninfectious liver disease and nonspecific [[Extrapyramidal movement disorders]] 
- Eye examination
- [[LFT]]
- Copper studies
	- Increased Free copper
	- Decreased total copper
	- Decreased Ceruloplasmin
	- Increased 24 h Cu Excretion
- Liver biopsy if other tests are inconclusive
	- May show copper staining (low sensitivity)
	- Hepatic Cu concentration > 250 mcg/g of dry weight
	- The normal hepatic copper concentration is < 50 mcg/g. In patients with 70â€“250 mcg/g dry weight, genetic testing is necessary. 
- Genetic testing
	- First degree relatives with WD
	- Inconclusive test
- MRI
	- Hyperintensities in BN, Thalamus, Pons, White matter
	- Face of Giant panda sign (rare but pathognomonic): Midbrain copper 






### Treatment
- Low copper diet
- Manage Hepatic symptoms
	- Decompensated cirrhosis: [[Liver transplantation]]
- Pharmacological
	- First line: [[Penicillamine]] or [[Trientine]] 
	- Alternative: Zinc salts 
		- Zinc ions reduce intestinal absorption of copper by inducing metal-binding proteins in intestinal enterocytes. The bound copper is then excreted fecally during normal enterocyte turnover. 
	- Chelating agents should be titrated gradually to prevent exacerbation of neurological symptoms
