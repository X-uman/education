- Advanced disease:
	- [[Abdominal Mass]]
	- [[bowel obstruction]]
	- [[Perforations]]
	- [[Lower GI Bleeding]] 
- Symptoms of [[Metastasis]] to various organs
- #Palpation [[Per rectal examination]] 

### Diagnostics
- [[Occult Blood Test]] for screening 
- Complete [[Colonoscopy]]
	- To examine the lesion and take biopsy 
	- to rule out additional tumors
#### Biopsy findings
 - #commonest Adenocarcinomas
	- Well differentiated to poorly differentiated
	- Invasion
	- Desmoplastic response: Firm Hard consistency
	- Mucus production: Into lumen or interstitium: Further spread
- Less common varieties
	- [[Mucinous Neoplasms]]
	- [[Signet ring cell Adenocarcinoma]]
	- [[Small cell carcinoma]]
### Other investigations
- [[Colonic cancers staging and treatment]] 
- [[Tumor Markers]]: 
	- [[Carcinoembryonic antigen]] (Normal <5ng/ml) for monitoring
- CBC: [[Iron deficiency anemia]]
- LFT: abnormal in metastasis of liver
- Genetic testing: for young patients, with family history 

### Prognosis 
- #prognosis by depth of infiltration of cancer, Mucin Production
### Screening and Follow-up
#high-yield
