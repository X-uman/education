### Etiolofy
- Congenital absence of [[Myenteric Plexus]] 
- Decreased [[Peristalsis]] 
- [[Large bowel obstruction]] due to absent propulsion
- Complications
	- Progressive dilatation of the colon proximally
	- [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] 
### Diagnosis
- Intestinal biopsy: Gold standard
	- Shows absence of ganglions, nerve trunk hypertrophy and staining shows increase Acetylcholinesterase activity in the involved segment 
- [[Barium study]]
	- Involved segment is contracted and proximally, there is dilatation of the normal segment
- Rectal manometry
	- Shows failure of internal anal sphincter to relax after dilation of normal proximal segment
	- Abnormal test is not diagnostic but,
	- Normal test rules out the disorder
### Management
- In patients with intestinal obstruction secondary to Hirschsprungâ€™s disease, a leveling ostomy or endorectal pull-through should be performed using ganglionated bowel, proximal to the transition zone between ganglionic and aganglionic intestine.
- Surgical resection of aganglionic segment and anastomosis
