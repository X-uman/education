### Enteropathogenesis
| Systemic hormoes                      | Effects                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Androgens]]                         | Increases sebum production and hyperplasia of gland                                                                                                                               |
| [[Estrogen]]                          | Suppress sebaceous gland activity, and presence of ovarian cysts does not correlate to the severity of acne in PCOS                                                               |
| Increase in Androgen: Oestrogen ratio | Correlates with severity. Sensitivity of sebaceous glands to active metabolic products of Testosterone, which result from reduction by 5-alpha reductase is more important factor |
| ACTH, GCC                             | aggravate the acne                                                                                                                                                                |
| Low SHBG, High DHEAs                  | Adult acne                                                                                                                                                                        |
- Increased keratinization in piliary canal due to persistence of [[Desmosomes]] leads to retention [[hyperkeratosis]]
- Decreased Linoleic acid levels
	- Increased sebum poor in [[linoleic acid]] and oily skin aka [[Seborrhea oleosa]] 
- Increased permeability of follicular wall and leakage and inflammation: Comedone formation
- [[Cutibacterium acnes]], [[Staphylococcus epidermidis]] furnish **lipases** which hydrolyzes Sebum TGAs into FFAs  which triggers inflammation 
- Host response to bacteria
- Hot and humid climate

### Presentation
- Polymorphic lesions
	1. Comedones and keratin plug: Pathognomonic
	2. Papules & Pustules
	3. Nodules, abscess, cystic
	4. Scarring 

### Severity grading

| Grade     | Description                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| I (Mild)  | Comedones, occasional papules<br>- Open comedones: black due to exposure of keratin to atmosphere<br>- Closed comedones: white |
| II (Moderate) | Mainly papules                                   |
| III (Severe) | Mainly pustules, nodules, and abscesses           |
| IV (Nodulo-cystic) | Mainly cysts and abscesses, widespread scarring as inflammatory lesions resolve |

### Management

| Severity     | 1st line                                                                                                    | 2nd line                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Mild         | [[Retinoids]], [[Benzoyl peroxide]]                                                                         | [[Azelaic acid]], [[Clascosterone]] |
| Moderate     | Combination of above +/- **topical** antibiotic                                                             | Hormonal therapy                    |
| Severe       | Combination + **Oral** antibiotic like [[Doxycycline]], [[Minocycline]] or azithromycin or **Isotretinoin** | Try different oral antibiotic       |
| Nodulocystic | DOC: [[Isotretinoin]]                                                                                       |                                     |

- Topical antibiotic: Clindamycin, or Erythromycin +/- Benzoyl peroxide
- Oral antibiotics: Tetracyclines, Macrolides
	- Doxycycline 40 mg OD, acts as antibiotic as well as anti-inflammatory 
- Hormonal: [[OCPs]], [[Spironolactone]], Steroids
- [[Chemical skin peeling]]
