### Basic Understanding
- [[Respiratory membrane]] 
- [[Laws of Diffusion]] 
- [[respiratory muscles]]
- [[Chest wall]] 
### Pathogenesis
- chronic [[inflammation]] and scarring (fibrosis)
- Thickening of Respiratory membrane and stiffening of alveoli
- Decreased rate of diffusion of gases and difficulty expanding alveoli i.e. **decrease compliance of lungs**
- O2 diffusion is affected more than CO2, because CO2 is very water soluble compared to O2
- Leads to [[Hypoxemia]] and Type 1 [[Respiratory failure]] 
- Hypoxia leads to Shortness of breath due to stimulation [[Respiratory center]] both by hypoxia as well as acidosis from [[Lactic acidosis]] 
- Scarring of the alveolar walls and subsequent stiffening of alveoli: **restriction of expansion of lungs**

### Etiologies
- [[Interstitial lung disease]] or [[Pulmonary fibrosis]] 
- [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]]
- [[Coal worker's Pneumoconiosis]] 
- [[Granulomatous diseases]] of lungs

### Clinical features
- [[Dyspnea]]
- [[Hypoxia]]
- Dry [[Cough]]

##### Clinical Examination
- **Inspection**: Normal
- **Palpation**: Normal 
- **Percussion**: Normal
- **Auscultation**: bilateral Fine Crepitation on inspiration similar as in [[Pulmonary edema]] 

### Investigation
- [[Chest X-ray]]
- High Resolution [[CT-scan]] (HRCT) of Chest
- [[Pulmonary function tests]] TO ESTABLISH RESTRICTIVE PATHOLOGY
- In Pneumoconiosis, demonstrate dust particles deposition in alveoli by Biopsy?????

### Treatment
- Initially, Give Oxygen if the patient is hypoxic to control symptoms of SOB
- Definitive: Lung Transplant
