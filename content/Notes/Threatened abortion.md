### Pathogenesis
- disruption of decidual vessels at the maternal-fetal interface
- these separations generally cannot be visualized by ultrasound, but may sometimes appear as a [[Subchorionic hematoma]]
- sub-chorionic hemorrhage or hematoma is associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss, particularly when it amounts to 25 percent or more of the volume of the gestational sac
### Diagnostics
- PV bleeding + Closed cervix + USG visualization of alive intrauterine pregnancy 
- pregnancy loss does not always follow vaginal bleeding, even after repeated episodes or large amounts of bleeding

### management
- Expectant management
- No benefit of progesterone in patients with threatened abortion and zero or one previous pregnancy loss
