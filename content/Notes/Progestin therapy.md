### Regimen
- Cyclical in Premenopausal women (12th to the 25th day)
### In endometrial hyperplasia
- All patients receiving progestin therapy should undergo:
	- Ultrasonographic follow-up after 3–6 months
	- Hysteroscopy with biopsy in the case of suspicious findings on ultrasound
- Just regular surveillance without progestin therapy is indicated if progestin therapy is:
	- Contraindicated (e.g., hormone-responsive cancer, progestin-receptor positive breast cancer)
	- Not tolerated or declined by the patient
