### What is it?
- A.M. temperature of >37.2°C (>98.9°F) or a p.m. temperature of >37.7°C (>99.9°F) would define a fever.

### What is happening
- [[Hypothalamus]] controls body [[Temperature]] 

### Patterns of fever
- Continuous
- Remittent
- Intermittent
	- Quotidian: Everyday for e.g. [[Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis]] 
	- Tertian: Every other day
	- Quartan: Every third day
- Relapsing if afebrile phase lasts > 24 h 
- Hyperpyrexia

### How is it happening?
- [[Endotoxins]]
- Pyrogenic [[Cytokines]] released from [[WBC]] and [[Endothelium]] 
	- [[Interleukin-1]]
	- [[Interleukin-6]]
	- [[Tumor Necrosis Factor]]
	- [[α-interferon]]
- [[Prostalandin E2]] originating from Endothelium of brain near hypothalamus activates glial cells which in turn stimulate increase of hypothalamic set-point.
	- PGE2 appears to play no role in normal thermoregulation, so inhibiting it with [[NSAIDs]] does not reduce core body temperature.

### Approach
- [[Complete Blood Count]] 
- [[Peripheral Blood Smear]] to see Band forms, toxic granulations and Dohle bodies which are suggestive of bacterial infection
- Neutropenia may be seen in some viral infections
- [[C-reactive protein]] and [[ESR]] in low grade fevers or with suspected occult disease. [[Acute phase proteins]]
- [[relative bradycardia]] 

### Management
- General: Sponging
- [[Antipyretics]]
