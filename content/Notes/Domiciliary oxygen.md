### Indications
1. Type 1 RF i.e. [[Hypoxemia]]  in stable patient
	- PaO2 < 55 mm Hg
	- [[Pulse oximetry]] <88%
2. unstable Patient with Respiratory failure, with complications of COPD like [[cor pulmonale]], [[Arrhythmias]], [[polycythemia]] 
	- PaO2 < 60 mm Hg
	- Pulse oximetry <90%
1. Even if paO2 > 60 mm Hg or sPO2 >90%, give Oxygen if, there is [[Sleep apnea]]

- Titrate O2 above 90%-92%
- Flow rate: 1-2 l/min 
- Give >= 15 h per day 
- don't give [[expectorants and mucolytics]]
- don't administer [[cough suppressants]]
- For patients started on LTOT, check blood gasses frequently (with ABG or VBG) to ensure adequate oxygenation without unintended acidosis and CO2 retention. 
- Reevaluate after 60â€“90 days (with ABG or pulse oximetry).  
### Advantages
- LTOT increases survival in patients with severe resting hypoxemia.
