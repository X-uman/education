### Pathogenesis
- Cryptoglandular abscess

### Diagnosis
- Tools often used in diagnosis include:
	- Fistula probe. An instrument specially designed to be inserted through a fistula
	- Anoscope. A small instrument to view the anal canal
- If a fistula is potentially complicated or in an unusual place, these tools may also be used:
	- Diluted methylene blue dye. Injected into a fistula
	- Fistulography. Injection of a contrast solution into a fistula and then X-raying it
	- Magnetic resonance imaging
- Tools used to rule out other disorders such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease include: 
	- Flexible sigmoidoscopy. A thin, flexible tube with a lighted camera inside the tip allows doctors to view the lining of the rectum and sigmoid colon as a magnified image on a television screen
	- Colonoscopy. Similar to sigmoidoscopy, but with the ability to examine the entire colon or large intestine

### Management

| Treatment Method                                      | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fistulotomy (standard approach)                       | Surgical procedure involving cutting open the fistula tract, allowing it to heal from the inside out. Often used for simple, low fistulas.      |
| Seton placement                                       | Placement of a non-cutting suture (seton) through the fistula tract to help drain the infection and gradually cut through the tissue over time. |
| Endorectal advancement flap                           | Surgical technique where healthy tissue from inside the rectum is used to cover the opening of the fistula, promoting healing.                  |
| Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) | Technique involving tying off the internal opening of the fistula tract to prevent fecal material from entering and causing infection.          |
| Fistula plug insertion                                | Procedure where a biologic plug is placed into the fistula tract to promote healing and closure of the fistula.                                 |
| Fibrin glue injection                                 | Injection of fibrin glue into the fistula tract to seal it shut and promote healing.                                                            |
