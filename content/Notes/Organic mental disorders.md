- Psychiatric disorders should be diagnosed after ruling out possible organic causes

| Organic                                                | Psychiatric               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Acute                                                  | Chronic (e.g. > 6m)       |
| Old age                                                | Younger age               |
| Altered sensorium                                      | No altered sensorium      |
| Neurocognitive deficit                                 | No Neurocognitive deficit |
| Simple hallucinations                                  | Complex Hallucinations    |
| Other hallucinations common, multimodal hallucinations | Auditory hallucination    |
| Diurnal variation (Sun-downing)                        | Not common                |



[[Dementia]] vs [[Delirium]] 

Features of Organic lesions ([[Cognitive functions]])
	- [[Altered consciousness]]  
	- Altered concentration
	- Impaired memory, intelligence, insight, [[abstract thoughts]], judgement 
	- Disorientation
	- [[Sleep Physiology]] 
	- Other hallucinations rather than auditory like
		- Visual: Considered organic unless proven otherwise
