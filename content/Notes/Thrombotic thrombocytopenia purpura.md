### Types
- Acquired/immune TTP
	- Seen in adults
	- Risk factors: Pregnancy, HIV, SLE, Drugs 
- Congenital TTP from childhood, recessive
	- Congenital TTP, sometimes also referred to as Upshaw Schulmann syndrome, often presents in infancy or childhood, in contrast to acquired TTP. 

### Pathogenesis
- Deficiency of ADAM-TS13 enzyme which cleaves [[von Willebrand factor]]
- Increased levels of vWH which leads to increased [[platelet adhesion]], [[Platelets activation]] , [[Platelet Aggregation]] 
- [[microvascular thrombosis]] with platelet rich thrombi
	- Tissue ischemia/infarction
		- Renal: [[AKI.canvas|AKI]] 
		- Brain: [[Stroke]], [[Features of Raised ICP]] 
	- [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia|Thrombocytopenia]] due to consumption of platelets
	- [[Intravascular Hemolysis]] 

### Clinical features
- Previously healthy **adult**, sometimes associated with triggers (e.g., infection, surgery, [[pregnancy]]), similar triggers as [[Antiphospholipid Syndrome]] 
- Presents with [[Altered consciousness]], [[fever]], petechiae, fatigue, and [[pallor]] 
- How to differentiate from [[Hemolytic uremic syndrome]] 
- [[Acute Kidney Injury]] in <10%, leading to [[Electrolytes]] imbalance, [[Hypertension]] 

## Lab 
- [[Coagulation panel]] may be normal/altered
	- [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]] 
	- Normal/increased PT/PTT
	- Normal/increased [[FDP]] and [[D-dimer]]
- [[Hemolytic markers]] 
- [[Acute Kidney Injury]] 
- Urine: [[Hematuria]], [[Proteinuria]] 
- Confirmatory: 
	- ADAM-TS13 activity: decreased
	- Anti-ADAM-TS 13 antibody: positive
- Study for secondary causes

### complication
- [[arterial thrombosis]]
	- Brain: [[Stroke]], [[Coma]]
	- Kidney: [[AKI.canvas|AKI]], [[CKD]] 
	- heart: [[Myocardial infarction]] 
	- Pancreas: Infarction and DM 
	- Liver: [[Ischemic hepatitis]] 
	- GIT: [[Ischemic Colitis]], [[Bowel necrosis]], Perforation, strictures, [[Intussusception]] 
- [[venous thrombosis]]
	- [[Deep vein thrombosis]]
	- [[Pulmonary Embolism]] 

### management
- [[Supportive measures]] 
	- Manage [[AKI.canvas|AKI]] 
	- Avoid Platelet transfusion 
	- packed RBC transfusion if Hb < 7 gm/dL
	- [[Thromboprophylaxis]] 
- Empiric treatment
	- [[Plasmapheresis]] ASAP
	- High dose steroids
	- Highly probably TTP if ADAM-TS13 testing is available : [[Caplacizumab]] 
	- [[Rituximab]] if ADAM-TS13 testing is not available
