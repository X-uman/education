### Invasive ductal carcinoma
- Commonest type of breast cancer (80%)
- Arises from precancerous intraductal lesion
- More aggressive, early metastasis 

#### Pathology
- Gross: 
	- Hard consistency due to desmoplastic reaction and fibrosis, hence called Scirrhous carcinoma
	- Infiltrative margins, may be fixed to skin/[[nipple-aerolar complex]] or underlying [[pectoralis major]] 
	- Gritty sensation while cutting
- Microscopy: Adenocarcinoma with desmoplasia and fibrosis

### Invasive lobular carcinoma
- 10% of breast cancers
- Slower growing and less aggressive than ductal carcinoma
- Slower metastasis than ductal carcinoma 
- Associated with [[HRT]] after menopause 

#### Pathology
- Gross: Either firm, sclerosed mass or ill-defined diffuse tumor
- Microscopy: small uniform cells infiltrating through fibrous tissue which may be arranged in rows or circles
	- Rows: single file pattern
	- concentric: Bull's eye pattern
