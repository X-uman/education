### Management
- Infants with omphaloceles have greater associated morbidity and mortality than infants with [[gastroschisis]] due to a higher incidence of congenital anomalies and pulmonary hypoplasia. 
- Gastroschisis can be associated with intestinal atresia, but not with other congenital anomalies. 
- An intact omphalocele can be repaired electively, whereas gastroschisis requires urgent intervention to protect the exposed intestine.
