- How does a fetus eat its own feces, imagine why cows and buffaloes have dung on their bodies, because they have to to sit where they shit, so it happens in [[Postmaturity]] and also in fetal distress
### Risk factors
- [[Meconium stained liquor]] 
	- [[Fetal distress]] 
		- [[Abnormal labor]] 
		- [[Postmaturity]] 
- Both of them lead to [[Meconium stained liquor]]: Green [[Notes/Amniotic fluid]] 

### Pathology
- [[Airway obstructions]] 
	- [[Atelectasis]] 
	- Obstructive [[Emphysema]] due to valve effect and rupture can cause [[Pneumothorax]] 
	- [[hyperinflation]] 
- [[chemical pneumonitis]]
- [[Surfactant deficiency]] due to [[Alveolar flooding]] 
- [[Respiratory failure]]
- Intrapulmonary [[R-L Shunt]] 
- [[Pulmonary Hypertension]] due to hypoxia

### Presentation
- [[Meconium stained liquor]] 
- Onset is immediately after birth
- Signs of [[chemical pneumonitis]]: Asymmetric, patchy opacities, [[Pleural effusion]] 
- [[Respiratory distress]] 
- Signs of [[Airway obstructions]] : Increased lung volumes, [[hyperinflation]] 
- [[Crackles (rales)]] and Rhonchi 
- Low [[APGAR score]]

### Complications
- [[Perinatal asphyxia]] related complications 
- [[Pneumothorax]] due to alveolar distension
- [ ] [[Pneumomediastinum]] #todo 
- [ ] [[Pneumopericardium]] 
- [ ] [[Persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn]] 

### Management
- [[Supportive measures]]
- Tracheal suction with a meconium aspirator is indicated if airway obstruction prevents effective PPV.
- Severe cases: 
	- [[Neonatal resuscitation]] 
	- [[PEEP]] by [[CPAP]] or [[Mechanical Ventilation]]: Can lead to [[oxygen toxicity]], High frequency ventilation 
	- [[inhaled nitric oxide]] to pulmonary hypertension 
	- [[Surfactant therapy]] 
	- [[ECMO]] maybe needed
