- Most common: spontaneous pneumothorax 
- Less common
	- Vascular disease

	- Endometriosis
	- Bony exostoses

### Diagnostics
- Clinical
	- Symptoms of an underlying disorder
	- If there is significant blood loss: hypotension, tachycardia
- Diagnostics
	- CXR: can show associated pneumothorax or malignancy
	- Ultrasound: heterogeneous fluid collection
	- Chest CT: hyperattenuating fluid collection; can reveal an underlying malignancy
	- Chest CTA: allows for the identification of the source of hemorrhage (e.g., vascular abnormalities)
- Pleural fluid analysis
	- Bloody appearance
	- RBC count > 5000 cells/mcL
	- Hematocrit > 0.5 × peripheral hematocrit
	- Laboratory studies: ↓ hemoglobin
