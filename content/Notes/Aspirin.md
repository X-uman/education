### Class 
- 


### Mechanism
- Irreversible [[COX]]-1 inhibition → inhibition of thromboxane (TXA2) synthesis in platelets → inhibition of [[platelet aggregation]] (antithrombotic effect)
    - Onset of antiplatelet action: within minutes
    - Duration of antiplatelet action: 7–10 days


### Indications
- Acute [[myocardial infarction]] as [[dual antiplatelet therapy]] 
- Acute [[ischemic stroke]]
- [[Angina]] (stable and unstable)
- Management of ASCVD
- Primary prevention of ASCVD and [[Colonic cancers]] 
- Symptomatic [[peripheral arterial disease]]
- [[Giant cell arteritis (Temporal arteritis)]]
- Prevention of stent thrombosis after revascularization procedures (e.g., PTCA, [[CABG]], [[carotid endarterectomy]])
- See “Non-opioid analgesics” for indications in pain management and inflammation.

### Contraindications
- [[Gout]] 


### Protocol/Procedure
- Low dose (below 300 mg/day): inhibition of platelet aggregation
- Intermediate dose (300-2400 mg/day): antipyretic and analgesic effect
- High dose (2400-4000 mg/day): anti-inflammatory effect

### Cautions
- In children, acetaminophen or oral ibuprofen must be used because aspirin increases the risk of [[Reye’s syndrome]].
- The lifespan of a [[platelets]] is 7–10 days. If aspirin is held prior to surgery, it should be discontinued one week in advance. [[Pre-operative management]] 


### Complications
- [[Upper GI-bleeding]]
- [[primary hemostasis]] disorder: Normal PT/PTT
- [[Tinnitus]]: 
- [[Acute Kidney Injury]] and [[Acute interstitial nephritis]] in long term use
- [[salicylates]] toxicity
- [[Hypersensitivity reaction]]: Cuteneous/[[Anaphylactoid reaction]] 
- Reduced [[Uric Acid]] elimination, so contraindicated in [[Gout]] 
- [[Reye’s syndrome]] 
- [[AERD]] 


### Management of Complications
- Emergency correction of the antiplatelet effect of aspirin can only be achieved by administering platelet concentrates.
