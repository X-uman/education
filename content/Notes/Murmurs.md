-   Harsh=High gradients + High Flow
-   Rumbling = Small gradients dependent on flow
-   Blowing = Large gradients with variable volumes
-   All Ejection murmurs are cresendo-decresendo (diamond)

- Sound depends upon:
	- Transvalvular Pressure Gradient and Velocity
		- Ideally Zero gradient [[Cardiac cycle]]
		- In stenosed valve: Ventricular contraction produces more pressure gradient than Atrial Contraction
	- Transvalvular Flow Duration
		- Aortic/Pulmonic trunks' volumes are less: Lasts less than duration of diastole: Early Diastolic murmurs 
		- Ventricular volumes more: Mitral/Tricuspid regurgitation: Holosystolic murmurs
		- Increased [[cardiac output]] 


- Early diastolic: Regurgitation from Trunks
- Mid diastolic: Stenosis of Atrioventricular valves, [[Austin-Flint Murmur]] 

- Mid systolic: Stenosis of Trunks
- Late systolic: Atrioventricular [[valve Prolapse]]
- Pan systolic: Atrioventricular Regurgitation, [[Ventricular Septal defect]], Increased Cardiac output
- Continuous: [[Patent Ductus Arteriosus]], [[Rupture of sinus of Valsalva]], [[Arteriovenous fistulae]] 

- [[Grading of murmurs]]
- Direction of Flow determines the radiation of murmurs
- [[Venous hums]]

### Eponyms
- Gram steel murmur: Early diastolic murmur due to [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
