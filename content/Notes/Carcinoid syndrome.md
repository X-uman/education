#### Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome
Liver metastasis needs to happen for [[Carcinoid tumor]] to manifest as carcinoid syndrome but if tumor is located outside [[Portal System]]
	[[Retroperitoneum]]
	[[Ovaries]]
	[[Bronchus]]

#### Presentation
#commonest symptom is Flushing ([[Vasomotor System]]) due to [[Serotonin]]
	Diffuse erythematous
	Violaceous
	Prolonged
	Bright red Patchy flushing #associated with Gastric Carcinoid

Bronchospasm due to [[Histamine]], see [[Asthma]] 
Explosive (added gas) watery [[Diarrhea]] due to Serotonin
[[Pellagra]] due to [[Tryptophan]] being diverted to [[Serotonin Pathway]] and less formation of [[Niacin]] 
CVS symptoms
	Right side more affected: [[Congestive Cardiac failure]] 
	#commonest lesion is in Pulmonary valve: [[Valvular stenosis]] in 90% cases
	#commonest affected valve is [[Tricuspid valve]]: [[Valvular regurgitation]] in 45% and [[Valvular stenosis]] in 40%

#### Investigation
Check Physiological excess of Serotonin and Histamine: 24 hour Urinary 5-Hydroxy Indoleacetic acid (highly specific)
[[Tumor Markers]]: Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin
For Tumor Localization #Radiology 
	#obsolete Somatostatin Scintigraphy 
	Gadolinium 68 Dotatate [[CT-scan]] is 95% for metastasis
For Metastasis
	Liver Metastasis: [[MRI]]
	[[PET-CT Scan]] is <30% sensitive because Neuroendocrine tumors have low Ki67 index
