### Definition
- Thyrotoxicosis: a hypermetabolic condition caused by an inappropriately high level of circulating thyroid hormones irrespective of the source. 
- Hyperthyroidism: a condition characterized by the overproduction  of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland; can cause thyrotoxicosis
	- Subclinical hyperthyroidism
	- Overt hypothyroidism: Patient experience symptoms of [[Thyrotoxicosis]]

### Etiology
##### Hyperfunctioning thyroid gland
- [[Graves disease]] (∼ 60–80% of cases)
- Toxic MNG (∼ 15–20% of cases)
- Toxic adenoma (3–5% of cases)
- TSH-producing pituitary adenoma (thyrotropic adenoma)
- [[β-hCG]] -mediated hyperthyroidism (hydatidiform mole, [[choriocarcinoma]])

##### Destruction of the thyroid gland
- Thyroiditis (see “Subacute thyroiditis”)
    - Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain thyroiditis)
    - Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis (e.g., postpartum thyroiditis)
- Drug-induced thyroiditis (e.g., amiodarone, lithium)
- Contrast-induced thyroiditis (Jod-Basedow phenomenon)
- Hashitoxicosis (see “Hashimoto thyroiditis”)
- Radiation thyroiditis
- Palpation thyroiditis: due to thyroid gland manipulation during parathyroid surgery.
- Exogenous thyrotoxicosis
- Ectopic (extrathyroidal) hormone production
    - Struma ovarii
    - Metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma

### Pathogenesis
- Generalized hypermetabolism (increased substrate consumption)
   - ↑ Number of Na+/K+-ATPase → elevation of basal metabolism → promoted thermogenesis
   - Upregulation of β-adrenergic receptors → hyperstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system
- Cardiac effects → ↑ cardiac output 
    - ↑ Numbers of ATPase on cardiac myocytes; ↓ amount of phospholamban (PLB) → ↑ transsarcolemmal Ca2+ movement → enhanced myocardial contractility
    - ↓ Peripheral vascular resistance
