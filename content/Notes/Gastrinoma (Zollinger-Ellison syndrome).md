### Points
- [[Gastrinoma triangle]] 
- Although some gastrinomas are benign, more than half of all gastrinomas are malignant

### Presentation
- Features of [[Peptic ulcer disease]] (produce gastrin which stimulates Acid secretion)
- Features of [[Malabsorption syndrome]] (obstruction of pancreatic duct/duodenum)
- Symptoms of [[MEN Syndrome]] (coincidence with other endocrine neoplasms)

### Diagnostics
- Best initial test: [[UGI endoscopy]] to see ulcers which are usually distributed as follows:

| Location          | Percentage |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Proximal duodenum | ~75%       |
| Distal duodenum   | ~15%       |
| Jejunum           | ~10%       |
- Mucosal folds are thickened
- ↓ Gastric pH and ↑ basal acid output (> 15 mEq/h), Gastric pH > 2.0 rules out a gastrinoma.
- Confirmatory tests
	- Gastrin levels in a fasting serum sample > 1000 pg/mL or 10-fold increase in gastrin levels is conclusive evidence of a gastrinoma.
	- If serum gastrin levels increase (> 100 pg/mL) but are not more than 1000 pg/mL, a secretin stimulation test should be performed
	- [[Secretin stimulation test]] (secretin causes a paradoxical and dramatic increase in the levels of gastrin within a few minutes in these patients)
- Imaging
	- CT/MRI
	- Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy
	- [[Endoscopic ultrasound]] prior to surgical resection
### Management
- Reduce acid production
	- PPI, H2 antagonists
	- Octreotide
- Surgical resection of non-metastatic cancer
- 50% are already metastatic at the time of diagnosis, so chemotherapy for those cases
