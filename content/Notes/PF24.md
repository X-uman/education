PF24 may be used interchangeably with FFP for all of the indications listed above, with the exceptions of factor VIII deficiency or protein C deficiency, which are treated with recombinant products or plasma-derived factor concentrates. In the rare event that specific factor concentrates are unavailable and these deficiencies must be treated with a plasma product, FFP should be used.
