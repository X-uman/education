### Introduction


---
### Etiology
- Most common hereditary heart disease
- [[Autosomal dominant]] with varying penetrance
- Most commonly caused by mutations of the sarcomeric protein genes (e.g., myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein C) â†’ disorganization of myocyte architecture characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 167, 216, 0.55)">myofibrillar disarray and fibrosis </span>
	- MYH7 gene: gene on the long arm of [[Chromosome 14]] that codes for the beta-myosin heavy chain, which forms a part of type II myosin in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells
	- MYBPC3 gene: gene on the short arm of [[Chromosome 11]] that codes for cardiac myosin binding protein C, which prevents the breakdown of thick filaments in cardiac sarcomeres
- Less commonly due to a mutation in cardiac sarcomeric proteins such as troponin and tropomyosin
- Other conditions causing [[LV hypertrophy]]
