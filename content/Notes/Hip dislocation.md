| Operative (open reduction with removal of incarcerated segments) | - Irreducible dislocation<br>- Radiographic evidence of incarcerated fragment<br>- Delayed presentation<br>- Non-concentric reduction |

### Non-operative reduction techniques


### Maintenance of reduction
- Hip immobilization with light traction with abducted hip
- Functional activity ASAP after pain subsides
- Hip protection: to prevent hip collapse due to unsuspected [[Osteonecrosis of Femoral head]]
	- About 6 weeks if Reduction done within 6 h
	- About 12 weeks if longer delay
- Graduated weight bearing

### Complications
- [[Sciatic nerve injury]]
- Superior gluteal artery injury 
- Associated [[Femoral shaft fractures]] 
- late complications
	- [[Osteonecrosis of Femoral head]]
	- Unreduced dislocation
	- [[Osteoarthritis]]
	- [[Myositis ossificans]]
