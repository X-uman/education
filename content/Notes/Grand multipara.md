### Management
- Grand multipara is considered [[High Risk pregnancy]]
- Required Adequate [[Antenatal care]] and mandatory Hospital delivery
- During labor:
	- Pelvic assessment should be done as routine
	- Presentation and Position should be checked
	- Undue delay should be viewed with concern
	- Take prophylactic measures against PPH
