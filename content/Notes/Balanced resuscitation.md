- Aka Hemorrhage control resuscitation 
- It is currently recommended that volumetric restoration of blood loss should be achieved via a 1: 1: 1: 1 blood component ratio of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitates
- The following goals of blood loss replacement are sought:
    - Hemoglobin of ≥ 8g / dL for older and CVS patients 
    - Platelet count ≥100,000 / dL
    - Normalization of coagulation times ([[Thromboelastography]] / Rotational Thromboelastometry)
    - Fibrinogen >100 mg / dL
- **Plasma** – 1 unit (as frozen plasma [FP], thawed plasma, or other plasma product) has a volume of 200 to 300 mL.
- **Platelets** – 1 unit of apheresis platelets contains 300 billion platelets, one-fourth of what normally circulates and one-sixth of what is in the body (one-third of platelets are in the spleen), but only half of transfused platelets typically circulate.
- **pRBCs** – 1 unit of pRBCs has a volume of approximately 325 mL and contains 160 to 220 mL of red blood cells (RBCs).
