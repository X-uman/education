- Presence of any of the following findings requires immediate evaluation for revascularization therapy (i.e., management is the same as that for STEMI).

| STEMI equivalent                                   | any of the following findings                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Posterior myocardial infarction                    | - ST depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1–V4<br>- ST elevations ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V7–V9          |
| Left main-vessel occlusion or three-vessel disease | - ST depression ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 6 leads <br>- Combined with ST elevation in leads aVR and/or V1 |
| LBBB or RBBB with strong clinical suspicion        | [[modified Sgarbossa criteria]]                                                             |

- Left main-vessel occlusion or three-vessel disease (Conditions leading to left ventricular remodeling (e.g., cardiomyopathy) can cause similar ECG changes.)
