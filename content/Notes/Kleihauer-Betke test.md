- aka HbF cytochemical demonstration test
- HbA2 is soluble in Citrate buffer with pH 3.2
- Quantitative testing to evaluate fetomaternal hemorrhage
- A maternal blood smear is exposed to acid and then stained. Adult hemoglobin is removed by the acid whereas fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is not, thus, cells appear pink on a positive test for fetal hemoglobin. 
- The amount of fetal hemoglobin determines the amount of Anti-D immunoglobulin necessary.
- Flow cytometry is an alternative, but its use is limited by equipment and costs.
