Total skull Volume: 1700 ml (Fixed due to bony architecture, but flexible in infants)
	Brain: 80%
	CSF: 10%
	Blood: 10%
		Arterial: 5%
		Venous: 5%

Skull volume = Brain + CSF + Arterial Blood + Venous Blood

If the volume of any one of above increases, then remaining others must decrease in volume to compensate to maintain normal ICP
e.g. 
	- Increased Brain size: [[Cerebral edema]], Brain tumors, Brain abscess
	- Increased CSF: Hydrocephalus
	- Increased Arterial Blood: Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage
	- Increased Venous blood: Sub-Dural hemorrhage, [[dural sinus thrombosis]], 

ICP increases once following components are displaced to accommodate the increased volume of Intracranial contents:
- Initially CSF is displaced
- Then Venous blood is pushed out
- Then Arterial flow decreases (Decreased [[cerebral perfusion]] Pressure)
- Then brain is displaced i.e. [[Cerebral herniation]] which may be
	- [[Subfalcine herniation]]
	- [[Uncal herniation]]
	- [[Central herniation]]
	- [[Transcalvarial herniation]]
	- [[Tonsillar herniation]] 
	- [[Upward transtentorial herniation]]
