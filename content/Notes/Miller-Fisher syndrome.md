- GQ1b ganglioside is selectively expressed in the cranial nerves that innervate the extraocular muscles (i.e., CN III, IV, and VI). 
- Autoimmune reactions with antibody formation against GQ1b ganglioside result in nerve inflammation and extraocular muscle weakness. 
- Specific test for MFS: Anti-GQ1b Antibodies
- Consequently, a serum GQ1b antibody assay is used to diagnose GBS variants that manifest with 
	- [[External ophthalmoplegia]]
	- [[Ataxia]]
	- Areflexia 
	- [[Bulbar palsy]] 
- A patient does not present with ophthalmoplegia, GCQ1b antibodies are unlikely to be present.
