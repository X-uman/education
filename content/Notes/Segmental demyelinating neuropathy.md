- A type of neuropathy characterized by loss of saltatory conduction. 
- Caused by damage to Schwann cells and breakdown of myelin over a few segments along the length of the internode, while the the axon or neuronal body remain intact. 
- [[Nerve conduction studies]] characteristically show prolongation of distal and F wave latencies and a decrease in conduction velocity. 
- Common causes include 
	- [[Guillian-Barre Syndrome]] 
	- chronicÂ inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy
	- [[metachromatic leukodystrophy]]
	- type 1 and type 4A Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
	- Dejerine-Sotta syndrome,
	- diphtheritic neuropathy. 

- The defects caused by segmental demyelination are typically reversible once Schwann cells regenerate.
