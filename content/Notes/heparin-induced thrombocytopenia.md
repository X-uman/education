### risk factors
- Female, surgery, use of unfractionated [[Unfractionated heparin]], duration >5d 
### Pathogenesis
- Platelets >50% drop from baseline typically
- [[hemorrhage]] is rare, instead [[Thrombosis]] which is paradoxical
- [[Unfractionated heparin]] and platelet factor 4 (PF4) form a complex → production of IgG antibodies against the heparin/PF4 complex → IgG antibody-heparin/PF4 immunocomplex binds on platelet surface → [[Platelets activation]] and aggregation → [[Thrombosis]] 
- consumption of [[platelets]] ([[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]]) and 
- arterial/venous [[thrombosis]]
- Thrombocytopenia also occurs due to [[Opsonization]] 

### Clinical features
- [[venous thrombosis]]
- [[arterial thrombosis]] is less common
- [[skin necrosis]] at injection site
- [[Anaphylaxis]] on injection
- [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]] is asymptomatic

4T: [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]], Timing of thrombocytopenia, [[Thrombosis]] and RO other causes

### Diagnosis
- PF4 heparin immunoassay
- Functional platelet activation assay
### Management
- differentiate from [[nonimmune heparin associated thrombocytopenia]] which
	- occurs within 5 days
	- mild [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]] (>1 lakh)
	- more common (10-30%)
	- clinically insignificant
	- no antibodies involved
	- heparin continued and platelets monitored
- stop heparin, avoid heparin following it
- other non-heparin [[Anticoagulants]] like Xa or IIa or Ia
- screen for asymptomatic [[Deep vein thrombosis]] paradoxically!
- check [[platelets]] before giving heparin to get baseline
