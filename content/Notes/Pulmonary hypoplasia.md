- Potter sequence, rib deformities, anasarca, scaphoid abdomen) as a result of the pathological processes that ultimately lead to pulmonary hypoplasia (e.g., oligohydramnios, thoracic dystrophy, fetal hydrops, diaphragmatic hernia).
- Underdevelopment of the lungs characterized by a decreased number of alveoli and small airways and reduced lung volumes in one or both lobes
- Results in impaired gas exchange and severe respiratory distress that may require intubation
- Associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (usually left-sided), [[oligohydramnios]], and [[Potter sequence]]
- [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] how are they different?
