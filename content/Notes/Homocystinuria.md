 **Definition**: a group of inherited genetic disorders characterized by impaired homocysteine metabolism
**Epidemiology**: affects 1:200,000–335,000 people worldwide 
**Etiology**: mutations in CBS, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, and MMADHC genes
    - Cause deficiencies in one or more of the following enzymes
        - Methionine synthase
        - Cystathionine synthase: an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine and serine to cystathionine, using vitamin B6 as a cofactor.
        - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR): an enzyme involved in folate metabolism that reduces N5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate.
    - Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate

- **Inheritance**: all enzyme deficiencies that cause homocystinuria are autosomal recessive
### Pathophysiology
   - Methionine synthase (homocysteine methyltransferase) deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into methionine
   - Cystathionine synthase deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into cystathionine
   - All forms result in the accumulation of homocysteine.

### Clinical features:
- Disease severity varies greatly. [28]
- Nonspecific features in infancy: growth faltering, developmental delay
##### Accumulation of Homocysteine 
###### [[collagen]] disruption 
   - Eyes
	  - Downward and inward subluxation of the ocular lens ([[ectopia lentis]]) after 3 years of age (in Marfan syndrome, the lens usually luxates upwards and outwards)
	  - [[Myopia]] and [[glaucoma]] later in life
   - Light skin
   - [[Marfanoid habitus]] 
   - [[Osteoporosis]]
   - [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] 

###### Neurotoxicity 
- Progressive [[intellectual disability]] due to neurotoxicity 
- Psychiatric and behavioral disorders
### Diagnostics
   - ↑ Homocysteine in urine and serum
   - Urine sodium nitroprusside test: Urine changes color to an intense red in the presence of homocysteine. 
   - Serum methionine levels
	  - Increased in cystathionine synthase deficiency
	  - Decreased in methionine synthase deficiency and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency


### Treatment
   - Some patients respond to large doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). [30]
   - Methionine synthase deficiency: high-methionine diet
   - Cystathionine synthase deficiency
	  - Low-methionine, high-cysteine diet
	  - Supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate
   - Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate: high-cysteine diet
   - MTHFR deficiency: supplementation of folate

[[Marfan syndrome]] and homocystinuria both present with marfanoid habitus. Distinguishing features include intellectual disability, which is only seen in homocystinuria, and the direction of lens dislocation (downwards in homocystinuria and upwards in Marfan syndrome).
The most important features of homocystinuria are Marfanoid habitus, skeletal abnormalities (e.g., osteoporosis, kyphosis), accelerated atherosclerosis, and downward lens subluxation: “Tall grown, brittle bone, vessels of stone, lens in downward zone.”
