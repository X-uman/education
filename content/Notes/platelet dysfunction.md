| Inherited | Von Willebrand Disease                     | Deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, leading to impaired platelet function                                                |
|           | [[Bernard-Soulier Syndrome]]               | Genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein Ib-IX                                                  |
|           | [[Glanzmann Thrombasthenia]]               | Genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa                                               |
| Acquired  | Drug-induced                               | [[Antiplatelet agents]]                                                                                                                  |
|           | Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or [[Uremia]] | Uremic toxins and metabolic abnormalities associated with CKD can impair platelet function                                               |
|           | Cardiopulmonary Bypass                     | During bypass surgery, platelets can be activated and surface molecules necessary for hemostasis may be disabled, leading to dysfunction |
|           | [[Multiple myeloma]]                       | Antibodies coating the platelets, interferes with clotting factors                                                                       |
