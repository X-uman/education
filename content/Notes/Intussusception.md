### Etiology 
- [[Rhinovirus]] URTI causing [[Payer's patches]] [[hypertrophy]] which form lead point
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)">search structure of intussusception</span>
- #MCC in children: [[Meckel's diverticulitis]]
- #MCC in adults: Benign tumors like [[Lipoma]], Leiomyoma
- #MCC in old age: Tumors (Colo-colic intussception)
- Associated with [[IgA Vasculitis]], [[Cystic fibrosis]] 
### Pathophysiology
- Lead points: Hypertrophied peyer's patches, [[polyps]], tumors, lipoma, [[Meckel diverticulum]] leading to: 
- Telescoping of intestine into distal portion
- Dragging of [[mesentery]] with its vessels
- [[bowel obstruction]] and [[Vascular insufficiency]], due to compression of mesentery, mainly [[venous obstruction]] and leading to congestion
- Bowel [[edema]] and [[ischemia]], [[Bowel Ischemia]] 
- Bowel [[infarction]]
- [[Bowel perforation]]
- [[Peritonitis]] 
- [[sepsis]] and [[Septic shock]] 
#### Presentation
- Mostly young children
- [[Vomiting]]: features of [[bowel obstruction]] 
- Crampy/Colicky Abdominal pain: Due to increased peristalsis
- <span style="background:#b1ffff">Red currant jelly stools</span>
- Inspection: Visible [[peristalsis]] 
- Palpation
	- Empty RIF
	- Sausage shaped mass in abdomen

#### Investigations
- #ioc  USG features
	- Target sign or Bull's eye or donut: Transversally
	- Pseudokidney sign: Sagittally,  also seen in [[Intestinal TB]] due to pulled up cecum presenting with a mass in sub-hepatic region
- Barium enema 
	- **Claw sign**
	- Coiled Spring sign
	- Crescent sign

#### Management
- **Infants**: #RxoC Air/saline enema: Hydrostatic reduction
- Children, Adults, Old age: #Surgical reduction if it is viable
	- Milk from above downwards, not try to pull apart
	- After reduction, find etiology and treat accordingly
- [[Hutchinson maneuver]]: a technique to reduce intussusception by pushing its lead point from the anal side to the oral side, in open surgery
- If Intussception part is not viable, do resection and anastomosis
