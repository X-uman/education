### Introduction
- MAC is the fraction of volume of the anesthetic present in the inspired air that provides sufficient analgesia in 50% of patients, meaning that patients will not respond to an extremely painful stimulus such as surgical skin incision at standard temperature and pressure.
- MAC ‚àù 1/potency
- Lower is the MAC, higher is the Potency of Anesthetic
- Lower is the MAC, higher is the Lipid and Blood solubility
	- [[Halothane]] has High Potency, thus Low MAC (0.75)
	- [[Nitrous Oxide]] has Low Potency, thus high MAC (104)
	- Least is for [[Methoxyflurane]] 

### Factors affecting MAC
- Needs to be high concentration in active people like children
- Alcohol users, drug users
- [[Hypernatremia]] 

### Decreased MAC
- Inactive patients, drowsy patients
- Pregnancy, anemia
- Hyponatremia
- Lithium, Verapamil users
