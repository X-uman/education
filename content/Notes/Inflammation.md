#### Acute inflammation

#### vascular response
- Redness due to increased circulation 
- Fluid collection due to exudation i.e. [[edema]]
- Increased temperature due to increased blood flow locally
	- Local: Local rise of temperature
	- Systemic: Fever due to prostaglandins acting on hypothalamus

[[Cell injury]]:
- Pain and tenderness due to prostaglandins and increased fluids pressure inside interstitial i.e. edema
- Loss of function of the [[Tissue]] or organ or apparatus

#### immunological response to remove cause of cell injury and remove injured cells
- [[WBC]] Migration to inflamed tissue and subsequent release of Reactive oxygen species and Proteases e.g. Trypsin
	- Deficiency of [[Alpha1-antitrypsin]] leads to uncontrolled inflammation especially in lungs leading to emphysema and liver leading to cirrhosis.

Causes of Acute Inflammation???
- cell injury


#### Chronic inflammation
- Repair: Scarring/fibrosis : Stiffening of tissue, loss of tissue architecture
- Destruction: Weakness of tissue and loss of function
- Extension: Damage of adjacent tissue
- Example: 
	- [[Granulomatous diseases]] 
	- [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] 

#### Systemic features of inflammation

Acute:
	- [[Fever]]
	- Malaise

Chronic:
	- Weight loss

- [[Inflammatory markers]] 
- [[Inflammation sequelae]]
