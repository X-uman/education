### Etiology
- Commonest Etiology: [[Viruses]] 
- Other: *See* [[Serositis]] 
#### Presentation
- Sudden, Pleuritic, retrosternal chest pain, radiating, aggravated by leaning back, coughing, swallowing or deep inspiration
- [[SIRS]] due to viruses most frequently
- Features of [[Sympathetic Overdrive]] when [[cardiac output]] is impaired due to effusion
### Clinical signs 
- Pericardial rub: Initially when fluid collection is scanty, Best heard over the left sternal border during expiration while the patient is sitting up and leaning forward
- Features of [[Pericardial effusion]] or [[Pericardial Tamponade]] 

### Diagnostics
- Mild rise in [[cardiac biomarkers]] 
- [[EKG]]: Global [[ST elevation]] 
	- Classic teaching of generalized concave up ST elevation and PR elevation in aVR is not reliable for distinguishing pericarditis from ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
	- Pericarditis can cause localized ST elevation but there should be no reciprocal ST depression (except in AVR and V1).
	- STEMI, like pericarditis, can also cause concave up ST elevation.
	- Only STEMI causes convex up or horizontal ST elevation.
	- ST elevation greater in III than II strongly suggests a STEMI.
	- PR segment depression is only reliably seen in viral pericarditis, not by other causes. It is often only an early transient phenomenon (lasting only hours). MI can also cause PR segment depression due to atrial infarction (or PR segment elevation in aVR).
	- You can’t rely on history either — STEMI can also cause positional or pleuritic pain. A pericardial friction rub
