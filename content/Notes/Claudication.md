- A pain of vascular origin that is reliably induced by exercise and relieved or reduced by rest. 
- The pain is typically cramping in nature and is most commonly described in the lower extremities (in lower limb peripheral arterial disease). 
- Claudication is caused by tissue ischemia secondary to arterial insufficiency.
### Management
| Therapies                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structured exercise therapy<br>(First-line therapy) | - Patients repeatedly walk or exercise until the onset of claudication and then rest until the pain subsides<br>- This cycle is repeated for 30-45 minutes, three times a week, for a minimum of 12 weeks<br>- Shown to improve patients' functional status and quality of life |
| [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] modification        | - Addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking cessation                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Persistent claudication despite first-line measures | - Consider [[cilostazol]] ([[PDE-3 inhibitors]])for symptomatic improvement<br>- OR [[revascularization]] if symptoms persist despite conservative measures                                                                                                                     |
