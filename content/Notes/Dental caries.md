- MCC is Streptococcus mutans
- MC Acid: [[Lactic acidosis]]
- [[anorexia nervosa]]: Gastric Acid due to repeated vomiting 
- Sugary food consumption promotes bacterial growth
- [[Bacterial biofilm]] from sugar: [[Dental plaque]]
	- Supra-gingival: Caries
	- Sub-gingival: [[Periodontal disease]] 
- Acid dissolution of enamel, dentine
- Bacterial growth: Abscess, cyst, necrosis, osteomyelitis 
![[15901604083168710_lg.jpg]]

### Stages
- Enamel caries
- Dentine caries
- [[Pulpitis]]
- [[Periodontitis]] 
- [[Periodontal disease]] 
- [[Periapical abscess]] 

### Presentation
- Maxillary more affected
- First Molars more affected
- Occlusion surface affected: More wear and tear
- Tooth pain/[[Halitosis]] 
### Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis
- X-ray: Small radiolucent areas in enamel and dentine, helps to know the depth
- Other method

### Treatment

| Condition                                                                 | Treatment                                                                                     |

| Very small lesion in which remineralization is still possible             | The application of fluoride gel, varnishes, pit, and/or fissure sealant usually suffices.     |
| Lesions that involve hard tissues but do not involve the pulp             | Caries excavation and restoration of the dental surface                                        |
| Lesions that involve both enamel and dentin in proximity to the pulp      | [[Indirect pulp capping]]                                                                    |
| Lesions that involve enamel, dentin, and pulp                            | [[Root canal treatment]], followed by extracoronal restoration                                 |


### Prevention

Complications: mostly caused by inflammation of the pulp
    - Apical periodontitis
    - Periapical abscess
    - Periostitis, osteomyelitis

### complications
- dental abscess
- osteomyelitis
- infection of the deep spaces of the neck
- Ludwig angina

### DDx
- [[Fluorosis]] 
- [[Dental hypoplasia]]
