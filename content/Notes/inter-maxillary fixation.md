| Technique        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Erich Arch Bars  | Semirigid bars providing scaffolding for each dental arch, wired together to secure occlusal relationship. Steps include reduction of skeleton and dental arch, cutting arch bar to length, securing to stable teeth with circumdental wire, trimming and rosetting wire ends, and securing arch bars to each other.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ivy Loops        | Loops made from 24-gauge wire placed between stable teeth, wrapped around each neighboring tooth and fed back through dental interspace, with ends twisted together and trimmed. Another wire is placed through opposing Ivy loops and tightened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Ernst Ligatures  | Temporarily stabilize fractures and simple fractures using a 24-gauge wire placed between premolar teeth, passed back through interdental space and twisted tight, with ends cut off. Pair of ligatures placed on each jaw, ends twisted together after placing patient in occlusion. Hooks may be created for elastics.                                                                                                                                               |
| Fixation Screws  | Rapidly applied screws placed mesially or distally to canine roots, with points identified 5 mm apical from dental root. Screw fully inserted on both maxilla and mandible, then a 24-gauge wire loop placed over screw shoulder on opposing jaws and tightened. Cross wires may be added for fracture stabilization. If predesigned screws unavailable, short plates may be used with screws, and wires placed through plate screw hole after establishing occlusion. |
| Other Techniques | Various methods, such as bonded dental lugs and Rapid IMF, utilize lugs fixed to enamel of teeth or plastic circumdental devices for short-term MMF. Custom acrylic splints may be fixed to mandible, serving as dental arch for maxillary-mandibular reduction immobilization, especially in edentulous mandibles. Patient's dentures may also serve this purpose if intact after trauma.                                                                             |
