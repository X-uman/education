- 14 yrs: 2 mL/kg/%TBSA for the first 8 hrs, then 0.5 mL/kg/%TBSA 
 - <14 yrs: 3 mL/kg/%TBSA for the first 8 hrs, then 1 mL/kg/%TBSA

- ==2ml x B.W. x %TBSA==  (previously was 4ml/BW/TBSA)
 - In addition, because of studies demonstrating serious complications from over-resuscitation (e.g., pleural effusions, compartment syndrome), the ATLS and American Burn Association now recommend only giving half of the fluid resuscitation volume that is calculated by the Parkland formula in adults.
- Half given before 8 h, other half in next 16 h from time of burn
