### Etiology
- [[ABO Incompatibility]] is the most common cause (~20%) but much milder (~5-10% are symptomatic), May see Spherocytes 
- [[Rh isoimmunization]] 
- [[Kell blood group system]] incompatibility
- Concurrent ABO and Rh incompatibility is less severe, if at all because ABO incompatible RBCs are rapidly cleared from circulation by IgM Ab
- [[Hereditary Spherocytosis]] 
- [[Sickle Cell disease]]
- [[Thalassemia]] 
- [[G6PD Deficiency Anemia]] 
- [[TORCH infections]]

### Risk factors
- [[Rh alloimmunization]]

### Presentation
- Mild: only lab evidence of hemolysis
- Severe hemolysis
	- Insufficient compensation: severe [[Anemia]] as Hb < 5-7 gm/dl in fetus
	- Pathological [[Neonatal Jaundice]] 
	- [[Extramedullary Hematopoiesis]]:  [[Hepatosplenomegaly]] (massive)
- Other features of severe hemolysis
	- [[Hyperinsulinemia]] due to pancreatic islet hypertrophy
	- [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia|Thrombocytopenia]] which shows as petechiae (see [[Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia]])
	- [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]]
	- [[Hydrops Fetalis]] 

### Diagnostics
- Collect both mother's and baby's blood and do blood grouping
- Direct [[Coomb's test]]
- [[Hemolytic markers]] 
### Management
- Prenatal:
	- [[Intrauterine transfusion]] 
	- Possible IV immunoglobulins in severe cases
	- [[Plasmapheresis]] 
- Postnatal
	- Iron supplementation, if necessary, [[Packed RBCs]] (According to the Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion (PINT) study, the Hb limit is 10 g/dL in the first week of life. )
	- Start [[Phototherapy]]
	- Do [[Exchange Transfusion]] if 
		- Cord Bilirubin >  5 mg
		- Cord hemoglobin < 10 mg/dl
	- [[IV Immunoglobulins]]
