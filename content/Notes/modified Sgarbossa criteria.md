- A set of ECG criteria that can help identify STEMI in patients with LBBB and high clinical suspicion of ACS. 
- The criteria can also be used in right-ventricular pacing with [[Left bundle branch block]] configuration but are less specific in this scenario.
- Acute STEMI is likely if any of the following are present: 
	- Concordant ST elevation of ≥ 1 mm in any lead
	- Concordant ST depression of ≥ 1 mm in any of leads V1–V3
	- Discordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm and ≥ 25% of preceding S wave
T-wave concordance means that the T-wave is oriented in the same direction as the QRS complex. T-wave concordance is a normal feature of all ECGs. However in a patient with a left bundle branch block, the presence of T-wave concordance signifies ischemia.
