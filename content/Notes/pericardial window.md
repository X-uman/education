- Creating a pericardial window is the most appropriate treatment for this hemodynamically stable patient with recurrent pericardial effusion. 
- In this surgical procedure, part of the pericardium is removed to continuously drain excess fluid from the pericardial space into the pleural cavity, providing pericardial decompression. 
- Pericardial window is often indicated in recurrent malignant pericardial effusion because it prevents the reaccumulation of fluid and, therefore, offers definitive treatment.
