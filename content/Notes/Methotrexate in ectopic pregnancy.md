- [[Methotrexate]] is preferred when
	- Hemodynamically stable without signs of impending or ongoing rupture 
	- Serum [[β-hCG]] ≤5000 mIU/mL
	- Absent fetal cardiac activity
	- Patient willing to comply, take consent, willing to follow-up 
	- mass size less than 3 to 4 cm (has not been confirmed as a predictor of successful treatment)
	- No contraindications of methotrexate

### Single dose regimen
- Single IM dose of MTX is preferred #todo/exam 
- Approximately 15 to 20 percent of such patients will require a second dose of MTX, and patients should be made aware of this before starting the protocol
- The dose used is 50 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA; maximum dose 100 mg in patients with normal renal function).
- In a commonly used protocol, on days 4 and 7, a serum hCG concentration is drawn
- If the decrease in hCG between days 4 and 7 is <15 percent, a **second** dose of MTX 50 mg/m2 IM is administered.
- It is common to observe an increase in hCG levels from day 1 through day 4, and this should not cause concern
- No need to repeat pretreatment lab testing if repeat dose is required
- After day 7, hCG testing is repeated weekly. On day 14
- If there is a ≥15 percent hCG decline from days 7 to 14:
    - Check hCG weekly until the level is undetectable (varies by laboratory).
    - hCG concentration usually declines to <15 milli-international units/mL by 35 days postinjection; some patients may take up to 109 days.
    - Risk of gestational trophoblastic disease is low.
- If hCG does not become undetectable, exclude a new pregnancy.
- If three weekly values are similar:
    - Administer an additional dose of MTX (50 mg/m2) to accelerate hCG decline.
- If there is a <15 percent hCG decline from days 7 to 14:
    - Give an additional dose of MTX 50 mg/m2 IM.
- If hCG is rising, perform a transvaginal ultrasound.
