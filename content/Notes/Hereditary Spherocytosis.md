### Presentation
- Most common inherited hemolytic disease among individuals of Northern European descent 
- Severe forms: [[Hydrops Fetalis]]
- Moderate HS: Presents in infancy or childhood and presents with 
	- Anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly
- Bone marrow is compensating Hemolysis by Bone marrow expansion and [[Extramedullary Hematopoiesis]]: [[Chipmunk facies]]

---
### Pathogenesis
- Mutation of Gene encoding ==Spectrin, Ankyrin [[RBC Membrane]]==
- Congenital RBC membrane protein defect
- Inheritance pattern
    - [[Autosomal dominant]] (∼ 75% of cases)
    - Autosomal recessive (∼ 25% of cases)
    - Family history often positive for relatives who required splenectomy and/or developed [[cholelithiasis]] at a young age
- 25% may not have family history, i.e. sporadically
- [[Extravascular Hemolysis]] is more pronounced than intravascular

### Diagnosis
- [[Complete Blood Count]]: 
	- Reduced [[Hemoglobin]]
	- RBC counts: Decrease
	- MCV: decreased
	- MCH: Normal
	- MCHC: Increased
- [[Peripheral Blood Smear]]
	- Increased Reticulocyte Percentage [[Hematopoiesis]], [[RBC destruction]], [[Notes/Hemolysis]] 
	- RBC becomes Hyperchromic
	- Central pallor is gone 
	- These cells are called spherocytes > 15%
- [[Hemolytic markers]]
- After treating with [[Blood Transfusion]]
	- Iron, Ferritin increases: [[Iron Overload]] happens
	- Transferrin saturation increases
- Bone marrow is compensating Hemolysis by Bone marrow expansion and [[Extramedullary Hematopoiesis]]: Hair on end appearance
- Overworking Exhaustion of Bone marrow: ==Aplastic/Hypoplastic crisis==: [[Aplastic Anemia]] especially during infections like [[Malaria]], [[Leishmaniasis]]

### Advanced Tests:
- Gold standard:  eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test  
- Glycerol Fragility test: Fragility increased
- Incubate RBCs Osmotic Fragility Increased
- The osmotic fragility test (OFT) was previously considered the gold standard, but two new tests, the acidified glycerol lysis test, and the EMA binding test, are more sensitive and specific for hereditary spherocytosis. The OFT can still be considered if neither of these two tests is available.

- Gel Electrophoresis of RBC Proteins
- [[DNA Analysis]]
---
### Treatment
- Symptomatic management
	- Regular Blood Transfusion: Patients are transfusion dependent
	- Jaundice: [[Phototherapy]] or [[Exchange Transfusion]]
	- Folic acid and B12 supplementation 
	- Monitor infections and treat early to prevent [[Hemolytic crisis]] esp. as a result of viral infection
	- For gallstones: [[Cholecystectomy]] 
- Definitive management
	- Splenectomy is both symptomatic and definitive
	- Gene Therapy
---
### Complications
- [[Hemolytic crisis]]: esp. as a result of viral infection
- [[Aplastic crisis]]: following infection with parvovirus B19 (erythema infectiosum); characterized by a low reticulocyte count (< 0.1% of total RBC count)
- [[Megaloblastic anemia]]: folate and vitamin B12 deficiency may develop due to chronic hemolysis and high RBC turnover
- [[Megaloblastic crisis]]: due to folate deficiency (although uncommon in developed countries, it might still be seen among pregnant women)
- Other
    - Bilirubinate gallstone formation, possibly leading to [[cholecystitis]], cholangitis, and [[pancreatitis]]
    - Growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities due to bone marrow expansion
- [[Cardiac Hypertrophy]] 
- [[Vaso-occlusive events]]
	- Multiple Skin ulcers
	- [[Priapism]]
