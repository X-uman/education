### Steps
| Step              | Description                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1            | Locate the lateral head of talus, about 1cm anterior to the lateral malleolus.                                       |
| Step 2            | Hold the foot using the thumb on the lateral head of talus and fingers holding the medial malleolus.                 |
| Step 3            | Correct **cavus** deformity by supinating the forefoot, elevating the first ray to create a normal arch of the foot. |
| Step 4            | Correct **adductus** deformity by gently abducting the foot, stretching ligaments on the medial side.                |
| Step 5            | **Varus** heel deformity corrects automatically as forefoot adduction is corrected.                                  |
| Step 6            | Correct **equinus** deformity once forefoot is abducted, aiming for 50-70 degrees of abduction before dorsiflexion.  |
| Step 7            | Apply plaster casts to maintain correction achieved by manipulation, ensuring proper technique to prevent slipping.  |
| Step 8            | Perform [[Achilles tenotomy]] to correct rigid equinus by complete cut through of the Achilles tendon.               |
| Maintenance Phase | After correction phase, wear foot abduction brace full-time for 2-3 months, then at night for 3-4 years.             |
| Surgical Option   | Consider Tibialis Anterior Tendon Transfer if relapse occurs despite splinting, typically after age two.             |
