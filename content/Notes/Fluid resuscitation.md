### Indications
- burns that are partial-thickness or deeper (2nd-degree burns to 4th-degree burns), and generally only when the total body surface area involved is ≥ 20%, as these burns cause excessive fluid loss that cannot be sufficiently replaced orally. 
- In patients with major burns, cytokine release causes increased vascular permeability and loss of intravascular volume leading to significant third spacing of fluid
### Regimens
- **Clearly apparent hypovolemia**: Aggressively replace volume deficit. 
    - IV fluid bolus over 10–30 minutes (using glucose-free isotonic crystalloids)
        - Adults: NS or lactated Ringer's 500–1000 mL IV bolus 
        - There is no consensus on the ideal type and amount of fluid used with bolus therapy, however, NS and LR at doses ∼ 10–20 mL/kg are most commonly used. There is a wide practice variance among clinicians, with some being more restrictive (e.g., 3–4 mL/kg/bolus) and others more liberal (e.g., 20–30 mL/kg/bolus). 
		- Children: NS or lactated Ringer's 10–20 mL/kg IV bolus

		- Repeat as needed based on individual hemodynamic monitoring parameters. E.g., adults with sepsis often require up to 30 mL/kg within the first hour of presentation. 
	- Hemorrhagic shock: Prioritize blood transfusion as soon as it is available (replace blood losses with blood products).

- **Uncertain hypovolemia or high-risk patients**: includes patients with risk factors for [[Fluid overload]] or clinical signs of hypervolemia
    - Assess fluid responsiveness, e.g., perform a [[Fluid Challenge Test]] or a passive leg raise . 
    - Fluid responsive: Repeat fluid challenge until there is no longer a response.
    - No response to IV fluids: Stop IV fluid boluses; start [[vasopressors]] or inotropes.
- After stabilization
    - Continue with volume titration; further fluid challenges can be performed.
    - Proceed with other strategies for IV fluid therapy according to the patient's needs.
The most important goal of IV fluid resuscitation is to maintain end-[[end-organ perfusion]] while avoiding fluid overload.
- Close monitoring of hematocrit, coagulation status, core temperature, and electrolytes (calcium and potassium especially) is essential when rapid infusion of large volumes of crystalloid (eg, >3 to 4 L) are given since this may promote dilutional coagulopathy, electrolyte imbalances, and hypothermia.
