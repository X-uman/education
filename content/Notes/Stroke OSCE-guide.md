[[Stroke]] 
### History of presenting illness
- Last seen normal exact time? [[Modified Rankine Scale]] 
- Main [[Focal neurological deficits]] 
	- How fast did they appear?
	- Are they consistent with vascular territory? 
	- Were they worsening en route ? Probably: [[Hemorrhagic Stroke]] growing and increasing 
	- How long did it take to reach hospital ?
	- Did they bypass a closer hospital en route?
- [[Features of Raised ICP]] 
- [[Meningismus]] 

### History of differentials?
- [[Stroke mimics]]

### Medical history
- [[HRT]] 
- [[Anticoagulants]] 
	- Non-adherence: Ischemic stroke 
	- coagulopathy may lead to hemorrhagic stroke 
### Examination
