- An intrathecally administered antisense drug that is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy, a motor neuron disease caused by a defective SMN1 gene. 
- Nusinersen induces differential splicing in the SMN2 gene, which then essentially takes over the role of the SMN1 gene.
- Needs annual Intrathecal injections
 - Risdiplam
    - mRNA splicing modulator that improves the efficiency of SMN2 gene transcription → ↑ systemic SMN protein concentration
    - Can be given orally, in contrast to nusinersen
