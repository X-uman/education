### Types
- Superficial laceration
- Deep lacerations: The anchoring stitch should be placed above the apex of the laceration, and each stitch should reach the base of the tear to avoid creating pockets for hematoma/seroma formation. The proximity of the bladder anteriorly, small bowel and rectum posteriorly, and the ureters and uterine vessels deep in the lateral vaginal fornices are important to consider as they can be included in placement of large deep sutures.


- [[Colporrhexis]]
	- Rupture of vaginal vault
	- Complete: When peritoneum opens up
	- Usual site: Posterior fornix
	- Associated with [[Cervical laceration]] in cases of lateral fornix 
	- If tear limited near cervix: repaired from below
	- If tear extends up to LUS: Laparotomy and [[Immediate hemodynamic support]] 
- Sutures should not be placed cephalad to the fornix, as this can result in ureteral ligation. A laparotomy (or angiographic embolization) may be needed when a vaginal laceration has extended above the fornix and appears to be expanding (either on imaging or because of persistent hemodynamic instability).
### Management
- Sitz baths are often prescribed two or three times daily to help with hygiene until external lacerations are healing well. 
- Depending upon the extent of trauma, pelvic rest for three to four weeks is also recommended to avoid disruption of healing tissue.
- Analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics, are used for short-term pain control.
- Topical lidocaine has minimal efficacy.
- Further supportive measures include use of vaginal lubricants for coitus and (vaginal) estrogen supplementation in hypoestrogenic patients
- Pressure necrosis of the swollen external genitalia may be prevented by having patients rest primarily on their side or back.
- Studies suggest patients who suffer trauma of the genital tract are more likely to suffer dyspareunia, sexual dysfunction, and chronic pain of the lower genital tract and pelvis
- Before suturing near the clitoris and urethra, the clinician should weigh whether repair of these areas may be more traumatic or painful than secondary healing alone. If repair is needed to achieve hemostasis or tissue reapproximation, then we use fine absorbable interrupted sutures
- Deep or large vaginal lacerations may be repaired in one or more layers. Exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy may be necessary for full evaluation of deep lacerations that extend through the posterior cul-de-sac and into the peritoneal cavity to rule out damage to internal organs. Diverting colostomy may be needed if the gastrointestinal tract is involved.
