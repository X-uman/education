- Out of all endoscopic procedures,  bears the highest risk of spleen injury. It is assumed that increased traction in the left upper colon flexure puts tension on the splenocolic ligament and/or preexisting splenocolic adhesions, thereby causing parenchymal tears and/or avulsion injuries. 

### Presentation
- Diffuse abdominal pain, especially in the left upper quadrant (LUQ), possible abdominal guarding
    - Kehr's sign: referred pain in the left shoulder 
    - Ballance's sign: dullness on percussion in the LUQ
- Hemorrhagic shock (often delayed): tachycardia and hypotension
- In delayed splenic rupture, symptoms may not present until days to weeks after trauma

### Diagnostics
- [[FAST scan]] is the first step in unstable patient which screens for subcapsular hematoma and free fluid 
- If free fluid is seen: [[Exploratory laparotomy]]/[[Diagnostic laparoscopy]]  
- In stable patients or after temporary stabilization
	- CECT abdomen is method of choice
	- Alternative: MRI with renal insufficiency or contrast allergy

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Liver injuries]] []

### Management

| **Stable** patient                           | **Unstable**            | Laparotomy                                                                                                                           |
