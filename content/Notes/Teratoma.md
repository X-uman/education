Teratomas
1. Mature (Benign)
2. Immature ( Malignant)
3. Monodermal( Highly Specialized)–Struma ovarii and carcinoid

### Mature Cystic Teratoma
- Also known as  “Dermoid cyst”
- A tumor with tissue arising from more than one germ layer.
- 3 Germ Layers–ectodermal, Mesodermal and Endodermal differentiation
- Mainly tissues derived from the ectodermal differentiation of Totipotent cells
- Commonest cell type: Neuroectoderm
- Cystic teratomas–Young adults during reproductive years
- Bilateral Teratomas–10 -20% of cases

### Gross
- Cyst contain Hair and cheesy sebaceous material
- Thin wall cyst lined by an Opaque wrinkled apparent epidermis
- From the epidermis --hair shafts protrude within the walls
- Tooth structures and areas of calcification
- Rokitansky nodule present
### ![[Pasted image 20240426105012.png]]Microscopy examination:
- Cyst wall is lined by stratified squamous epithelium with underlying sebaceous glands, hair shafts and other skin adnexal structures.
- In most cases –Structures from other germ layers can be identified. 
- E.g.: Cartilage, bone, thyroid tissue.
- 1% of dermoid cysts undergo malignant transformation
- E.g.: Most common–Squamous cell carcinoma
- Thyroid tissue growth: [[Struma ovarii]] 

### Clinical features
- [[Chronic pelvic pain]]
