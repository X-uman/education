### Notes
- there are no good data to support restricting fluid intake (of any kind or any amount) more than 2 h before induction of general anesthesia in healthy patients undergoing elective (other than gastric) procedures; moreover, 
- there is strong evidence that nondiabetic patients who drink fluids containing carbohydrates and protein up to 2 h before induction of anesthesia experience less perioperative nausea and dehydration than those who are fasted longer.
- Proper [[Aseptic technique]] 
- Mark the Surgical Site
