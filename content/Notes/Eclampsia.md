### Definition
- in most patients, eclampsia is a clinical diagnosis based upon the occurrence of new-onset tonic-clonic seizures in the absence of other causative conditions (eg, epilepsy, cerebral arterial ischemia and infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, drug use) in a patient with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, HELLP syndrome.

### Presentation
- [[Generalized tonic-clonic seizure]] 
	- Premonitory signs
		- Twitching of facial muscles
	- Tonic phase
	- Clonic phase
	- Stage of coma
		- Status eclampticus
- Most patients have premonitory signs/symptoms in the hours before their initial seizure, such as hypertension and proteinuria, headache, visual disturbances, and/or right upper quadrant or epigastric pain.
- Fetal bradycardia lasting at least three to five minutes is a common finding during and immediately after an eclamptic seizure. Emergency cesarean birth is not needed unless the fetal heart rate tracing does not improve within 10 to 15 minutes of maternal and fetal resuscitative interventions.
- Can occur before term, antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum (early or late i.e. within 1week)
### Management
- Terminate prolonged acute seizure activity
	- If seizure resolves within 2-3 min, start [[Magnesium Sulfate for seizure prophylaxis]] 
	- If seizure > 5 min: manage as [[Status Epilepticus]]

- TTP and HUS may be indistinguishable from eclampsia that occurs in a patient with HELLP syndrome
