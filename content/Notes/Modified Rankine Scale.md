 The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used clinical tool for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability.

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **0** | No symptoms. |
| **1** | No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities. |
| **2** | Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities but able to look after own affairs without assistance. |
| **3** | Moderate disability; requiring some help but able to walk without assistance. |
| **4** | Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance. |
| **5** | Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent, and requiring constant nursing care and attention. |
| **6** | Dead. |

The mRS is widely used in both clinical practice and research to assess the impact of stroke and the effectiveness of interventions. It provides a standardized measure of functional outcomes and helps guide treatment decisions and rehabilitation planning.
