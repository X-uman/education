1. Stage 1: Analgesia
2. Stage 2: Excitement (Dangerous)
3. Stage 3: Surgical Anesthesia
	- Plane 1: Eyeball rolling
	- **Plane 2**: Loss of corneal reflex, no blinking (surgical procedures done at this state)
	- Plane 3: Pupil dilatation, Muscle relaxation 
	- Plane 4: Only Abdominal respiration, Fully dilated pupil
4. Stage 4: [[Medullary paralysis]]: Loss of Respiratory and vasomotor control
