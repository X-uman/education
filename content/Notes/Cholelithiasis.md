### Etiologies
- Defective GB emptying:
	- [[Gall Bladder Hypomotility]]
	- Gallbladder outlet Obstruction
	- [[Biliary tract infection]] 
- Supersaturated bile
	- [[Hypercholesteremia]]
### Types
- [[Mixed stones]] are commonest type 
- [[Cholesterol stones]] 
- [[Pigment stones]]

### Clinical features
- Mostly asymptomatic 
- [[biliary colic]]
- Acute Calculous [[Cholecystitis]]
- Gallstone [[Pancreatitis]]
- Porcelain GB due to [[chronic cholecystitis]] 

### Complications
- [[Cholecystitis]]
- [[choledocholithiasis]], [[Mirizzi syndrome]] 
- [[cholangitis]]
- [[gallbladder empyema]], [[Gallbladder mucocele]] 
- Gallbladder perforation 
- Fistulation to large intestine
- Fistulation to duodenum: [[Gallstone ileus]] or Bouveret syndrome
- [[Obstructive jaundice]]
- [[Biliary carcinoma]]
- [[Pancreatitis]] 

## Investigations
- [[USG abdomen]]
	- Echogenic foci
	- Low level echogenic material in dependent portion": [[biliary sludge]] without [[acoustic shadowing]] with slow movement with patient's posture
	- Suspect [[choledocholithiasis]] and determine risk of choledocholithiasis by [[predictors of choledocholithiasis]] 
- [[MRI]] abdomen without and with IV contrast with [[MRCP]]
	• Indications
		• Preferred second-line test if ultrasound findings are inconclusive
		• Suspected [[choledocholithiasis]] 
	 (see ''Diagnostics'' in choledocholithiasis for further details)
	• MRI without contrast is preferred in pregnant patients.
• Supportive findings: well-defined hypointense (on T2) filling defect(s) within the gallbladder lumen 

## Differential diagnosis of intraluminal GB pathology
- [[cholangiocarcinoma]]
- [[Gallbladder polyp]]

## Management
- Asymptomatic:
	- Medical management: [[Bile salts]] that dissolve Cholesterol <5mm stones: [[Ursodeoxycholic acid]] for 6-24 months 
	- Surgical management: [[Elective cholecystectomy]]  
- Symptomatic: 
	- Uncomplicated: Manage [[biliary colic]] 
		- Surgical: [[Elective cholecystectomy]] 
		- Non-surgical ([[ASA scoring]]): [[Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy]]
	- Complicated: Manage according to complications
