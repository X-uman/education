 Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus endemic to the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. Infection typically occurs via exposure to bird or bat droppings. Immunocompetent patients with this condition are usually asymptomatic but if a large inoculum of the pathogen is inhaled or the patient is immunocompromised (e.g., the patient has AIDS, transplanted organs, and/or takes immunosuppressive medications), atypical pneumonia (e.g., dry cough, dyspnea) and systemic symptoms (e.g., low-grade fever, malaise, joint pain) can occur. The best initial test in the case of suspected histoplasmosis, especially for patients who are acutely ill, is a urine or serum test for the galactomannan antigen of H. capsulatum. This test is less specific because of crossreaction with antigens of other fungi. A fungal culture of bronchoalveolar lavage is more specific but takes longer (up to 6 weeks). Localized pulmonary histoplasmosis is typically treated with itraconazole and disseminated histoplasmosis with amphotericin B.
This patient takes immunosuppressive medications and has nonspecific constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, fatigue, weight loss), oral ulcers, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary involvement (e.g., cough, crackles, hilar lymphadenopathy, well-defined pulmonary nodules), pancytopenia, and increased transaminase levels. These findings, in combination with living in an area endemic for Histoplasma capsulatum (Ohio), are consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis.
