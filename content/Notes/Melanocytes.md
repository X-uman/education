- Dendritic cells Present in stratum basale
- Derived from [[neural crest cells]] except in [[Retina]] which are derived from Optic cup
- Contain Melanosomes which contain [[Melanin]]
- Melanocytes move along dendritic process and get transferred to keratinocytes (surrounding 36) which form Epidermal melanin unit which gives uniform melanin color 
- Stain positive for Melan A, HMB-45
- Shades of skin color variance due to
	- Variance in size, number and spatial distribution of melanosomes
	- Proportions of Eumelanin and pheomelanin
	- does not depend upon number of melanocytes
- Skin shades classification (1-6) based on property of skin to tan and burn
	1. Never tan but always burn (more chances of skin cancers)

### Defects of melanocytes
- [[Vitiligo]] due to death of melanocytes
- [[Piebaldism]] 
- [[Lentigens]] due to localized increase in melanocytes as macules 

### Defects of melanosomes
- [[Nevus depigmentosus]] due to defective transfer of melanosomes
