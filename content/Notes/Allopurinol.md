- At low concentrations allopurinol acts as a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase and at higher concentrations as a non-competitive inhibitor. 
- However, most of its activity is due to the metabolite oxypurinol which is a non-competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.
- #cautions with Thiazides, Penicillin allergy
- ADRs
	- [[Granulomatous hepatitis]]
	- [[TEN/SJS]] (Contraindicated in HLA-B*5801 allele which is in Black & south asians, check alleles before initiation)
- Needs dose adjustment in CKD
- Purine analogs (e.g., [[azathioprine]], [[6-mercaptopurine]]) combined with XOIs can cause bone marrow toxicity 
- [[Probenecid]] and [[thiazides]] decrease the efficacy of allopurinol 
- [[Purine metabolism]]
