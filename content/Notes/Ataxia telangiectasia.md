- [[Neurocutaneous syndromes]] 
### Pathogenesis
- ATM Kinase gene mutation
- Kinase activates other repairing genes like
	- [[p53]] 
- defective [[dsDNA break repair]] → accumulation of mutations → tumor development and 
- immunodeficiency (combined B and T cell immunodeficiency) for [[Somatic hypermutation]] ? Helps to repair those intentional breaks
- Autosomal recessive

### Diagnostics
- Neuroimaging: [[Cerebellar atrophy]] 
- High [[Alpha Fetoprotein]] due to neurodegenerative process or impaired differentiation 
- Low Immunoglobulins IgA, G, E
- Low Lymphocytes
- Genetic testing for ATM 

### Presentation
- Age of onset: 6-18 months
- [[Cerebellar signs]] 
	- Aspiration
- [[Extrapyramidal movement disorders]]
- [[Ocular motility disorders]] 
- [[Dyssynergia]] 
- T-cell immaturity/apoptosis leading to Lower B-cell function and Antibodies [[IgA deficiency]]  
	- [[immunocompromised status]]
- Mutation accumulation
	- [[Leukemia]]
	- [[Lymphomas]]
	- [[Gastric Carcinoma]] 
	- [[Spider angiomas]] 
- Patients require wheelchair by adolescence 
- MCC of death is malignancy
- Life expectancy: 25 y
### Treatment
- Ig Supplementation
- Antibiotics
- [[Beta-Blockers]] for ataxia
- Surveillance for cancers

### DDx
- [[Cerebral palsy]]
- [[Friedreich ataxia]]
- [[Ataxia-telangiectasia-like-disorder type 2]]
- [[Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1]]
- [[Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2]]
- [[RIDDLE syndrome]]
- [[Niemann-Pick disease]]
- [[Gaucher disease]]
