### Pathogenesis
- [[Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia]] 
	-  [[Biliary tract infection]]: Increased UC Bilirubin in [[Hepatobiliary tract]]
- Formation of [[Calcium]] Bilirubin salts
- Bacteria acts as nidus for formation of the stones

### Etiologies
[[Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia]]  causes: 
- [[Chronic hemolysis]]
- [[Biliary tract infection]] 
- [[cirrhosis]]
- [[Inflammatory bowel disease]]
- [[Ileal resection]]
- [[Cystic fibrosis]] 
- [[pancreatic insufficiency]] 

### Examination
- Brown to Black, Found Anywhere in Biliary Tree, Multiple, soft, Greasy, friable
- Black
	- ==Sterile Gallbladder Bile==
	- radiopaque, 
	- Ca Salts(Po4, Co3)
- Brown/[[Mixed stones]]
