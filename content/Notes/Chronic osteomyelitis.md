- [[Cicerny and Mader staging system]] 
- Hallmark: Sequestrum ([[Osteonecrosis]]) within compromised soft tissue envelope which is sclerotic, relatively avascular bone covered by thickened periosteum and scarred muscle and Subcutaneous tissue which leaves systemic antibiotics ineffective
- Secondary infections common


### Radiographic classification

| Jones et al. | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| A            | [[Brodie abscess]]                           |
| B            | Sequestrum involucrum                        |
| B1           | Localized cortical sequestrum                |
| B2           | Sequestrum with structural involucrum        |
| B3:          | Sequestrum without sclerotic involucrum      |
| B4           | Sequestrum without structural involucrum     |
| C            | Sclerotic, Physeal damage Proximal or distal |

### Presentation
- Most commonly seen after trauma with muscle injury
	- Grade III [[Open Fractures]] e.g. [[Farm injuries]] 
	- Need for [[Blood Transfusion]]
	- Need for multiple debridement 
- Complicated by [[implants]] and [[fracture nonunion]]
- Sinus tract
- Overlying skin changes: fibrosis and pigmentary changes
- Probe-to-bone test positive in an [[Ulcers]] 
	- A sterile blunt probe is inserted into the ulcer; direct contact of the probe with the bone indicates potential underlying osteomyelitis.

### Diagnosis
- Biopsy with culture and sensitivity is gold standard
- Signs of Cortical destruction and [[periosteal reaction]] strongly suggest
- Sinography if sinus tract present
- Normal [[Gallium scan]] excludes Osteomyelitis and useful for follow up 
- [[Indium 111-labelled leukocyte scan]] most sensitive and help to differentiate chronic Om from [[Neuropathic arthritis]] in [[Diabetic foot]] 
- CT useful in identifying sequestrum
- MRI with [[Gadolinium]]: Most sensitive 
	- Rim sign or Ring enhancement? around active disease 

### Management
- Manage [[immunocompromised status]] 
- Surgery
	- Sequestrectomy
	- Resection for eradication of infection
		- Radical debridement with wide margin as in [[Surgical oncology]] 
		- Fill up [[Dead space]] using [[PMMA]] or [[Calcium sulfate]] beads with Antibiotic mixture
		- [[Reamer]], ream the medullary canal and inserting gentamycin impregnated rod and beads
- Definitive treatment for carcinoma
	- Wide local excision or [[Amputation]] 
- High risk of [[Deep vein thrombosis]], so daily [[Aspirin]]
