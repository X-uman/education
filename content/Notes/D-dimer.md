- A negative D-dimer assay (i.e., levels < 500 ng/mL) allows DVT to be ruled out, 
- while a positive D-dimer (levels ≥ 500 ng/mL) is nonspecific and requires a venous ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis
- High sensitivity (∼ 96%) 
- Low specificity (∼ 36%)
- Not reliable for ruling out DVT in patients with intermediate or high PTP 
- preferred initial test for nonpregnant patients with a low PTP of DVT (Wells score = 0) 
- Preferred initial test for pregnant or postsurgical patients even if the PTP of DVT is low is Compression ultrasonography
- If the patient is > 50 years of age, adjust for age: age x 10 ng/mL = cutoff value in ng/mL
- D-dimer levels increase with age. Age-adjusted D-dimer testing retains a high sensitivity for PE but improves specificity in the older population, leading to fewer false positives.
