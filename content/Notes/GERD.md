### Risk factors for GERD
- [[Gastroesophageal junction]] 

### Presentation
- Effects of reflux on esophagus, larynx, mouth, teeth, lungs
- red-flags [[Dysphagia]], [[odynophagia]], Anemia, [[Upper GI-bleeding]], unintentional weight loss, vomiting

### Management
- Lifestyle changes (Personal history)
	- Diet
	- Weight
	- Smoking 
	- Sleep
##### Medical management
- Empiric [[PPI]] for 8 weeks if no red flags and no [[dyspepsia]]

| Response                         | Management Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Good response with complications | - Continue current treatment regimen. <br>- Monitor closely for any signs of complications or adverse effects.                                                                                         |
| Partial response                 | - Consider increasing the dose of the current treatment.<br>- Supplement with H2-blockers if not already prescribed.<br>- Monitor patient response closely after adjustments.                          |
| No response                      | - Reevaluate the patient's condition thoroughly.<br>- Consider further diagnostic evaluations, such as endoscopy or pH monitoring.<br>- GERD should not be ruled out as a potential cause of symptoms. |
| Relapse after discontinuation    | - Conduct pH monitoring to confirm the recurrence of acid reflux.<br>- Reassess the need for maintenance therapy and consider long-term management options to prevent relapse.                         |


These steps outline a systematic approach to managing different scenarios encountered during the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

- [[UGI endoscopy]] 2-4  weeks after discontinuing PPI
- [[Esophageal pH Monitoring]] if GERD is refractory to PPI, or [[NERD]] suspected or before anti-reflux procedure
- Patients who fail twice daily PPI therapy should also undergo esophageal pH monitoring.
#### Surgical management
- [[Fundoplication]]
- [[Linx surgery]]
- [[Stretta procedure]]: damaging esophagus deliberately and making a [[Rubbish/2023-10-16/Strictures|Strictures]] 
- [[Hiatal hernia]]: Combine fundoplication with hiatoplasty and, in some cases, gastropexy.
- Patients with obesity and reflux undergoing bariatric surgery: Consider Roux-en-Y. 
### Complications 
1. [[Reflux esophagitis]] is commonest
2. [[Barret's esophagus]]
3. Anemia due to chronic bleeding from erosion and ulcers
4. [[Esophageal stricture]]
5. [[Esophageal ring]]
6. [[Aspiration Pneumonitis]] 
7. [[Chronic bronchitis]]
8. [[Asthma]]
9. [[Reflux laryngitis]] 
10. [[Peptic ulcer disease]] at GEJ
