- Cholescintigraphy 
- Commonly referred to as hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scintigraphy or a HIDA scan.
- Indications: preferred confirmatory test for suspected uncomplicated acute cholecystitis if ultrasound findings are inconclusive
- **Advantages**
	- High sensitivity (96%) and specificity (90%); considered the gold standard test to diagnose acute cholecystitis
	- Can differentiate between acute and chronic cholecystitis

Characteristic findings
	- Normal: gallbladder visualized within 4 hours of administration of radioactive tracer
	- Acute cholecystitis: gallbladder is not visualized within 4 hours


### HIDA Scan
- **Radiotracer:** Technetium99m Hepatolite (HIDA)
- **Injection Route:** Intravenous
- **Binding Time:** Immediate imaging as injection enters the body
- **Purpose:**
    - Evaluates biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, abnormal biliary leakage, acute cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis
- **Clinical Indications:**
    - Diagnosis of biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, biliary leakage, cholecystitis
- **Imaging Time:** Imaging starts after 60 minutes of injection
- **Image Quality:** Provides visualization of liver and gallbladder
- **Duration of Procedure:** Shorter duration as immediate imaging is performed
- **Common Applications:**
    - Diagnosis of biliary tract abnormalities, evaluation of gallbladder function
