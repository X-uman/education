## *Etiology*

### Vessel wall
- [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] 
#### Platelets
- [[Thrombocytosis]]
- abnormal [[Platelets activation]]
	- [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]]
	- [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura]] 
	- [[Antiphospholipid Syndrome]] 
- [[Hyperviscosity syndrome]] 

### *RBCs*
1. Thalassemia
	- The altered surface of erythrocytes and erythroblasts has a procoagulant effect.
	- These mechanisms **are** more prominent in postsplenectomy patients. see [[Asplenia]]
	- Annual advanced coagulation studies Including D-dimer, thrombin AT III complexes, fibrinopeptide A, and prothrombin fragments are done


### [[Coagulation system.canvas|Coagulation system]]

##### Increased levels of coagulant proteins
- [[Fibrinogen]], prothrombin and reduced [[Protein C]] and [[Protein S]]: [[OCPs]], [[Pregnancy]] and postpartum and in [[HRT]] 
- [[Tissue]] factor and cancer procoagulant: 
	- [[paraneoplastic syndrome]], 
	- [[Trauma]], [[Burns]] 
	- [[Notes/placental abruption|placental abruption]] 
	- [[amniotic fluid embolism]]
	- acute promyelocytic leukemia
- [[Nephrotic Syndrome]] 
- elevated Factor 8 
- balance between <font color="#ffc000">procoagulant</font> and <font color="#c00000">anticoagulant</font> factors is disrupted in [[Chronic liver disease]] 

###### Abnormal activation of coagulant proteins
- [[Antiphospholipid Syndrome]]
- [[stasis]]: 
	- [[Hyperviscosity syndrome]] 
- [[Hyper-homocysteinemia]] 
- [[Nephrotic Syndrome]] 

###### Mutation of coagulant proteins
- procoagulant: [[Factor V Leiden]]
- anticoagulant:
	- [[Protein C]]: venous thrombosis
	- [[Protein S]]: both
	- [[antithrombin III deficiency]]
	- [[prothrombin mutation]]



## Presentation
- [[venous thrombosis]]
- [[arterial thrombosis]]
- [[microvascular thrombosis]] 
	- [[skin necrosis]]
