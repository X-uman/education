Here's the information about different Plasmodium species tabulated:

| Plasmodium Species    | Fever pattern                             | Fever spikes       | Characteristics                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Plasmodium falciparum | most severe form                          | Irregular          | - Most virulent and causes the most severe disease (falciparum malaria). <br> - Dominant in Africa.                                                          |
| Plasmodium vivax      | Tertian malaria (usually less severe)<br> | Every 48 hours<br> | - Most common of the less virulent species and causes milder disease. <br> - Dominant in endemic areas outside Subsaharan Africa (e.g., Southeast Asia).     |
| Plasmodium ovale      | Tertian malaria (usually less severe)     | Every 48 hours     | - Less common and causes milder disease.                                                                                                                     |
| Plasmodium malariae   | Quartan malaria (usually less severe)<br> | Every 72 hours     | - Less common and causes milder disease.                                                                                                                     |
| Plasmodium knowlesi   | Quotidian malaria<br>                     | Every 24 hours     | - Found in Southeast Asia and can cause severe malaria. <br> - Possibly zoonotic and often misidentified as other species due to morphological similarities. |
