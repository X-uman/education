### Components
The CAGE questionnaire is a widely used, brief screening tool for identifying potential problems with alcohol use. It consists of four questions, with the name "CAGE" derived from key words in each question:
1. **C**ut down: "Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?"
2. **A**nnoyed: "Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?"
3. **G**uilty: "Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?"
4. **E**ye-opener: "Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?"
### Scoring
- Each "yes" answer scores one point.
- A total score of 2 or more indicates a possible [[Alcohol dependence]] and suggests further evaluation is warranted.

### Interpretation
- **0-1 points**: Low risk for alcohol dependence.
- **2-4 points**: High risk for alcohol dependence; further assessment by a healthcare professional is recommended.
