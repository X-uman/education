- Chronic variant of communicating hydrocephalus in Old patients
- Imaging: MRI brain (preferred) , CT head
- Ventriculomegaly without or out of proportion to sulcal enlargement
    - **No evidence of CSF flow obstruction**
    - Periventricular white matter changes are often seen.

- CSF tap test: lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure, followed by removal of 30–50 mL of CSF
    - Opening pressure is typically normal or mildly e.levated: 5–18 mm Hg 
    - Gait is assessed immediately before and after the test.
    - Gait improvement following CSF removal supports the diagnosis and can help predict response to cerebral shunt placement.

### Clinical features
- Wet, Wobbly, wacky
	- Wacky: Dementia
	- Wobbly: Ataxia
	- Wet: Incontinence 

- CSF analysis: to assess for causes of secondary NPH (e.g., chronic meningitis)
##### - Temporary measures
- Interim drainage procedures
	- Serial lumbar punctures
- Pharmacotherapy
	- Diuretics (e.g., furosemide, acetazolamide)
	- Intraventricular fibrinolytic agents

##### Definitive treatment 
- Cerebral shunt

###### - Types of cerebral shunts
- [[Ventricular shunts]]: most common
