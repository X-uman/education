### Causes
- Autoimmune
	- [[Multiple Sclerosis]]
	- [[Neuromyelitis optica spectrum]] 
	- [[Uveitis]] and SO
	- Systemic:[[Granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] , [[Sarcoidosis]]
- Infectious
	- Local spread
		- [[Endophthalmitis]]
		- [[Orbital cellulitis]]
		- [[Meningitis]], [[Encephalitis]], [[brain abscess]]
		- [[Sinusitis]]
	
	- Systemic spread
	- Drug induced
		- [[Isoniazid]]
		- [[Etanercept]]
		- [[α-interferon]]
		- [[Methanol]]
		- [[Quinine]]
		- Smoking
	- Viral: Herpetic
	- Bacterial: Chronic granulomatous
	- Fungal
	- Protozoal
	- Parasitic

### Pathogenesis
- [[Demyelination]] of [[Optic nerve]]
	- [[Papillitis]]
	- [[Neuroretinitis]]
	- Retrobulbar neuritis

### Presentation
- Typically young White ladies between 20-45 years of age
- Sudden painful loss of vision, in papillitis is there painless loss of vision?
	- which may be profound,
	- usually unilateral,
	- where the commonest visual field defect is central scotoma, others may be Centro cecal, arcuate, Sectoral, Altitudinal or generalized reduction of acuity
	- Marcus Gunn Pupil or ill sustained constriction to light
- [[Swinging Flashlight Test]]: Pupil dilated on shining light on affected eye
- Pain exacerbated by eye movement and eye pressure, or tenderness
- Symptom worsening with increasing body temperature or Utthoff phenomenon
- Motion of pendulum perceived as elliptical movement or Pulfrich Phenomenon
- Majority have Spontaneous improvement starting from 3 weeks, near normal by 4-5 weeks, but color vision, contrast sensitivity and VF take longer and may not completely return to normal again

#### Ophthalmoscopic findings
- Disc: in papillitis
	- Edema: Blurred disc margins and enlargement of disc, normally <2x original size (Papilledema is >2x size)à
	- Central or Centro cecal scotoma (in papilledema there is enlarged blind spot)
	- Erythema shows tortuous and distorted retinal veins
	- Late: Post neuritic OD atrophy: Margin blurred, floor dirty grey and perivascular sheathing
	- Vitreous haze

- Peripapillary: Flame hemorrhages and exudated
	- Macular star pattern of exudates

- Retrobulbar neuritis: Patient and doctor cannot see any retinal findings, normal fundus
	- Abnormal pupils makes us suspect RAPD, Do MRI
- Neuroretinitis: Papillitis and macular star formation

### Investigations
- MRI with contrast
- [[Nerve conduction studies]]: [[Visual evoked potentials]]
	- Delayed latency and decreased amplitude, So pupils are abnormal
- [[Lumbar puncture]]: CSF ==Oligoclonal bands== confirms Multiple sclerosis
- [[Neuromyelitis optica spectrum]] (NMO/ Devic's Disease): ==Aquaporin 4 antibody - AQ4 Ab==
- FA: To differentiate other causes: Dilated and telangiectatic vs leak from capillaries
- For atypical ON:
	- Inflammatory markers: CRP, ESR, Mantoux, DLC
	- Serological tests: ANA, Toxoplasma, Lyme, Syphilis
	- CT PNS

### Treatment
- 1 gram IV methylprednisolone x 3 day, 
- Oral for next 11 and taper over next 4 days
- Oral prednisolone contraindicated
- IV [[Glucocorticoids]] may accelerate visual recovery but no effect on ultimate visual gain
- Treatment with immunomodulators (Interferon beta la and 1b) may be considered for patients whose MRI  findings suggest high risk of developing Multiple sclerosis

- Posterior sub-tenon Triamcinolone
- Vitamin B12
- Treat underlying cause
