### Origins
- [[Internal Carotid Artery]]
- [[Aortic arch]] 

- Atheroembolic disease can also occur following Percutaneous catheterization of the [[aorta]], or, spontaneously, due to [[cholesterol]] crystal embolization resulting in partial or total occlusion of multiple small arteries within the kidney. 
- Over time, a foreign body reaction can result in intimal proliferation, giant cell formation and further narrowing of vascular lumen, accounting for generally subacute decline in renal function.
- High risk patients are those undergoing [[Cardiopulmonary Bypass]], [[Aortic cross clamping]] and Intraperitoneal procedures
- [[CPB machine]] can cause activation of leukocytes, hemolysis and aortic injury with resultant Atheroemboli.
