Epilepsy in which at least two medications, given in adequate dosages either as monotherapy or combination therapy, have failed to prevent seizures.
### Surgery
- Resection (surgical removal of pathological lesions)
	- Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (e.g., due to hippocampal sclerosis): resection of the anteromedial temporal lobe or of the amygdala and the hippocampus
	   - Patients with severe intractable seizures due to structural cerebral abnormalities confined to one hemisphere: resection of an entire hemisphere (hemispherectomy)
- Disconnection (surgical section of neuronal circuits)
	   - Callosotomy: section of the corpus callosum 
		  - Initially: partial disconnection only (usually the anterior â…”)
		  - If seizures persist: complete disconnection
   - Hemispherotomy: disconnection of the cortex of one hemisphere from the ipsilateral subcortical structures and cortex of the other hemisphere without removal of the affected hemisphere [61]

### Other
- Stimulation techniques: vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation
- Dietary measures: ketogenic diet
