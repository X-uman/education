### Risk factors
- [[Complete mole]] > [[Partial mole]]
- In non-molar pregnancy, it is the commonest type of GTN (metastases are more common than after a molar pregnancy)
### how it all started
- Can arise from any type of pregnancy
- Origin: Pre-villous trophoblast from early [[implantation]] or from villous surface of placenta or from germ cells of gonads
- No Chorionic villi as in Moles
- [[Sub-involution of Uterus]], bleeding, enlarged ovaries and vagina lesions

### Diagnostics
- Tissue biopsy
	- choriocarcinoma consists of invasive, highly vascular, and anaplastic trophoblastic tissue made up of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without villi
	- Dimorphic pattern: Cytotrophoblast/Intermediate trophoblast + Syncytiotrophoblast 
	- Hypervascular mass invading [[Myometrium]] and beyond with enlarged uterus

##### Other modalities 
- Immunohistochemical markers: HCG, inhibin, cytokeratin, and Ki-67
- [[Metastasis]] is through Hematogenous route to lungs, vagina
	- Lungs shows Cannonball metastasis
### Management
- [[EMA-CO Regimen]] and [[EMA-EP regimen]] 
### similar concept
- [[Alien Movie]] how it grows rapidly and bursts the hosts leading to perforation, hemorrhage 
- [[Angiofibroma]] or [[Glomus tumor]] biopsy is very risky, similar in case with it
- Like [[Renal cell carcinoma]] intravascular tumor invasion 
- 

### great to know
- [[Dactinomycin]]
- [[Invasive mole]] 
- [[placental site trophoblastic tumors]]
