 - Definition: a pathologically increased growth of bacteria in the small intestine
- Etiology
    - Anatomic causes
        - [[Short bowel syndrome]]
        - [[Blind loop syndrome]]: bacterial overgrowth in the bypassed intestinal segment (blind loop) that occurs as a result of gastrectomy
        - Small bowel [[Diverticulosis]]
        - [[Inflammatory bowel disease]]
    - Motility disorders 
        - [[Irritable bowel syndrome]]
        - [[Diabetes mellitus]]
        -[[Systemic sclerosis]]
    - Gastrointestinal conditions
        -[[ Atrophic gastritis]]
        - [[Chronic pancreatitis]]
    - Iatrogenic: as complication of gastric bypass procedures

- Pathophysiology: all resulting from bacterial overgrowth
    - ↓ Absorption of vitamin B12, fat-soluble vitamins, zinc, and iron 
    - ↑ Production of folate
    - ↑ Deconjugation of the bile acids

- Clinical features
    - Diarrhea, [[steatorrhea]]
    - Abdominal discomfort, flatulence
    - Weight loss, malabsorption

- Diagnostics
    - Jejunal aspirate cultures collected during endoscopy  ( >10e5 CFU/mm )

- Positive lactulose breath test

- Management
    - Antibiotic therapy
    - Parenteral supplementation of vitamins and proteins
    - In some cases, surgical treatment
