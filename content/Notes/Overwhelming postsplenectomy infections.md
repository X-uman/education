### Introduction
Fulminant sepsis that develops in asplenic individuals as a result of infection by encapsulated organisms (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae). The risk of OPSI is highest among children under the age of 6 years. Patients initially have flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise), but rapidly deteriorate within hours.
### Management
OPSI has a high mortality rate if left untreated, and patients should receive empirical therapy with vancomycin and an intravenous third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) immediately upon suspicion of OPSI.
