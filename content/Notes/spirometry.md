To check the **Airway function** and **compliance of lungs**!!!
 i.e. check obstructive diseases [[Airway obstructions]] 
 It can also check restrictive lungs diseases

It checks for airflow rate of Expiratory phase
Trying to demonstrate Prolongation of expiration... because air is not able to go out fast enough... due to obstruction.

- **How ?
	- Ask patient to inhale as much air as they can.
	- Then, ask them to exhale as forcefully as they can.**

Normally, no airway obstruction
**In 1st second of exhalation, you exhale 80% of air** is called Forced Expiratory Volume in 1st sec, or FEV(1).
 - Remaining 20% in next second or so...
 - Total Exhaled is 100% : Forced Vital Capacity

- Normal ratio is FEV1 : FVC is 0.8 which is 80%
- In Obstructive FEV1 : FVC ratio will decrease
- **To diagnose it should be <70%**
- 70-80% is *at risk*

FEV1: 800ml
Predicted FEV1: 1200ml
  800/1200 x 100% = 66%

#### Grading of COPD
% of predicted FEV1 (according to your age, height, race, etc.)
>1. 80: Mild
>2. 50-80%: moderate
>3. 30-50%: severe 
>4. <30%: Very severe


IN restrictive lung disease:
- FEV1: decreased
- FVC:  decreased 

FEV1 + FEV2 + FEV3 + ... = FVC

FEV1/FVC ratio: Normal .... 
If FEV1, FVC decreased, then [[Restrictive lung disease]] 

#### Preserved Ratio, impaired Spirometry (PRISm) for prevention
- Seen in former smokers, Low BMI
- 40-50% develop COPD in next 5 years
- In risk of CVS mortality

### Pre-COPD
- Respiratory symptoms + Risk factors / Structural lesions / Low FEV1 / Gas trapping / hyperinflation / Reduced DLCO / rapid FEV1 decline
- But ratio >0.7 post broncho-dilation
- Needs treatment
