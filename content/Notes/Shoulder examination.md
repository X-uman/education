[[Shoulder anatomy]] 

Before commencing, perform [[Cervical spine examination]] as it can refer pain to shoulder/scapular region 
Also [[Thoracic outlet syndrome]] 
##### Look from all directions: AP, Lateral 
- Posture 
- [[gait & Ataxia]] 
- Joint Attitude 
- Deformity
	- Step deformity: Fractures 
- Muscular contour 
	- All muscles surrounding the joint 
- Symmetry
	- [[Sprengel deformity]] 
- Length 
- Scars, erythema 

##### Feel
- [[Inflammation]]: Temperature, tenderness 
- Tendons, muscles 
- Joint lines 
- [[Joint stability]] 
- Joint crepitus 

##### Move: Range of movements
- Active
	- [[Painful arc]] during abduction
	- drop arm during adduction
	- Apley's scratch test for internal rotation 
	- [[Scapulothoracic rhythm]]
- Passive in plane of limitation 
	- Passive normal in NM disease 
- End feel
	- Bony: Severe Osteoarthritis
	- Soft: Ligamentous/tendinous disease 
	- Global restriction: [[Adhesive capsulitis]] 
- Resisted isometric testing for [[Muscle Power]] 

##### Special tests 
- [[Shoulder dislocation]] 
- [[shoulder instability (TUBS and AMBRI)]] 
- [[Subacrominal impingement syndrome]] 
- [[Rotator cuff injuries]] 
- [[Serratus anterior]] 
- [[Bicipital tendonitis]] 
- [[acromioclavicular joint]]
