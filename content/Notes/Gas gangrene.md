### Introduction
- Rapidly spreading infection by gas forming bacteria involving mainly skeletal muscles 
- Earlier known as malignant edema
### Etiology
- [[Clostridium]] perfringens
- Traumatic gas gangrene is most commonly caused by _C. perfringens_; spontaneous gangrene is most commonly caused by the more aerotolerant C. septicum. 
- Other pathogens include _C. septicum_, _C. novyi_, _C. histolyticum_, _C. bifermentans_, _C. tertium_, and _C. fallax_.
- - Non-clostridia organisms like [[Coliforms]]
### risk factors
Conditions associated with traumatic gas gangrene include:
	- Gunshot wounds, knife wounds
	- Compound fractures, crush injuries
	- Bowel and biliary tract surgery
	- Abortion
	- Retained placenta
	- Prolonged rupture of the membranes
	- Intrauterine fetal demise
	- Intramuscular injection
	- Black tar heroin injection (skin popping)

### Pathophysiology
- Introduction of organisms directly into deep tissue occurs in trauma, creating an anaerobic environment optimal for growth of clostridial organisms.
- Gas gangrene entails severe muscle necrosis with a notable absence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in infected tissues, unlike infections caused by organisms like Staphylococcus aureus.
- In clostridial infections, PMNs adhere to vascular endothelium but do not cross into infected tissue, contributing to tissue destruction.
- Clostridium perfringens produces several extracellular toxins implicated in pathogenesis
- Large aggregates of platelets and PMNs inhibit PMNs from crossing endothelial cell barrier into infected tissues, mainly due to alpha toxin-induced activation of platelet fibrinogen receptor.
- Shock in gas gangrene may result from direct myocardial suppression by alpha toxin and indirect effects of theta toxin inducing vasodilation and reducing systemic vascular resistance.
- Gas gangrene-associated shock may not allow compensatory mechanisms seen in gram-negative sepsis due to negative inotropic effects of alpha toxin.
- The roles of other endogenous mediators like cytokines and vasodilators in gas gangrene-associated shock remain incompletely understood.
- Release of [[bacterial toxins|Exotoxin]] 
	- Clostridium releases proteases such as hyaluronidase, lecithinase and haemolysin, which allow it to spread through the tissues
	- Alpha, Beta, Epsilon, Iota
	- Phi: [[Myocardial depression]]
	- Kappa: Destroys connective tissue
	- Bursting factor
	- circulating factor
- Effects
	- Extensive tissue necrosis with gas production
	- Gases: H2S, Nitrogen, CO2 which stains muscle brown or black: Anerobic myositis/myonecrosis
  

| Effect                  | Alpha Toxin                                                                                                                  | Theta Toxin                                                                                               |

| Type                    | Hemolytic toxin with PLC and sphingomyelinase activities                                                                     | Member of cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family                                                          |
| Essential for Mortality | Yes                                                                                                                          | No                                                                                                        |
| Pathogenesis            | Causes tissue necrosis and suppresses tissue inflammatory responses by  stimulating platelet                                 | Contributes to pathogenesis, but not essential for mortality                                              |

| Effects on PMNs         | Inhibits PMNs from crossing endothelial cell barrier into infected tissue, leading to their sequestration within vasculature | May be cytotoxic to PMNs in high concentrations, reducing their migration into tissue                     |
| Shock Induction         | Directly suppresses myocardial contractility and may contribute to profound hypotension                                      | May induce endogenous mediators such as prostacyclin and platelet activating factor, causing vasodilation |
| Additional Effects      | Potently stimulates platelet aggregation, Upregulates adherence molecules on PMNs and endothelial cells                      |                                                                                                           |

### Clinical presentation
- IP: 1-2 days
- Sudden onset of severe pain at the site of surgery or trauma.
    - Mean incubation period is less than 24 hours, ranging from 6 hours to several days.
    - Pain likely related to toxin-mediated ischemia.
- Skin Changes:
    - Initially, skin over the infected area may appear pale, then rapidly develops a bronze appearance.
    - Followed by purple or red discoloration.
    - Skin becomes tense and exquisitely tender.
    - Overlying bullae may be clear, red, blue, or purple.
- Systemic Toxicity:
    - Signs of systemic toxicity develop rapidly, including tachycardia and fever.
    - Progression to shock and multiorgan failure is common.
    - Shock is present in 50 percent of patients at the time of hospital presentation.
- Bacteremia:
    - Occurs in about 15 percent of cases.
    - May be associated with brisk intravascular hemolysis. (see [[Notes/Hemolysis|Hemolysis]])
    - Experimental in vitro studies suggest both alpha and theta toxins contribute to intravascular hemolysis.
- Complications:
    - Jaundice, renal failure, hypotension, and liver necrosis are additional complications.
    - Renal failure largely due to combined effects of hypotension, hemoglobinuria, and myoglobinuria.
    - Bacterial toxins may also directly affect renal tubular cells.
- Bacteremia without Gas Gangrene:
    - Can occur transiently in patients without gas gangrene.
    - Majority of C. perfringens and C. septicum blood isolates associated with clinically significant infection.

### Diagnostics
- Diagnostic Criteria:
    - Pain at site of traumatic injury, systemic toxicity, and gas in soft tissue support diagnosis of gas gangrene.
    - Crepitus in soft tissue is the most sensitive and specific clinical finding.
- Radiographic Imaging:
    - Computerized tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal gas in deep tissues.
    - Useful in determining if infection is localized or spreading along fascial planes, especially early in infection.
- Cultures:
    - Blood (both aerobic and anaerobic bottles) and tissue cultures should be obtained.
    - Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of large gram-variable rods at the injury site.
    - Clostridia can appear gram-positive or gram-negative directly from infected tissues but stain as gram-positive rods in culture media.
    - Drainage from surgical procedures lacks frank pus.
    - Histopathology shows widespread tissue destruction, presence of organisms, but absence of neutrophils.
- Surgical Exploration:
    - Muscle does not bleed or contract when stimulated.
    - Grossly edematous muscle with reddish-blue to black discoloration.
    - Microscopic evaluation demonstrates organisms among degenerating muscle bundles and absence of acute inflammatory cells.
    - Necrosis of skin, fat, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia may also be present.
- Needle Aspiration or Punch Biopsy:
    - Provides etiologic diagnosis in at least 20 percent of cases.
    - Should not replace thorough surgical exploration and debridement with retrieval of specimens for Gram stain and culture.

### Management
- [[Surgical debridement]] 
	- Possible [[Hysterectomy]] in septic abortion
- Empirical antibiotics
	- In the setting of polymicrobial infection, Clostridium is presumed to be a significant pathogen. Piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g intravenously every eight hours) PLUS clindamycin (900 mg intravenously every eight hours) is the preferred option
	- Carbapenems are an acceptable alternative to piperacillin-tazobactam
- Definitive antibiotics
	- combination of penicillin (3 to 4 million units intravenously every four hours) plus clindamycin (900 mg intravenously every eight hours) or tetracycline (500 mg intravenously every six hours)
	- For patients with penicillin allergy, clindamycin can be used alone
	- Antibiotics should be continued until no further debridements are needed and the patient's hemodynamic status has normalized
- Adjunctive measures
	- [[Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy]]
	- Antitoxin for passive immunotherapy is not available

### Prognosis
- Ease of debridement is more in an extremity
- Associated Sepsis, hemolysis have highest mortality

[[Spontaneous gas gangrene]] 

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Necrotizing soft tissue infections]]
- Wound infection due to [[Vibrio vulnificus infection]]
- [[Pyomyositis]] due [[Staphylococcus aureus]]
- Viral [[Myositis]]
- [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
