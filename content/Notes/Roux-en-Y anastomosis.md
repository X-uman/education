- Roux limb: 15 cm
- Y-limb
- Disadvantages
	- 2 anastomoses needed
	- Exacerbates problem with gastric emptying in patients with [[Gastric Outlet Obstruction]] and motility problems tend to develop over time 
	- While Roux limbs divert biliary and pancreatic secretions away from the stomach, this advantage does not outweigh the disadvantage of poor drainage; plus, it requires an additional anastomosis. Thus, it should not be the preferred method of reconstruction for patients undergoing partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease.
- Complications
	- [[Internal Hernia]] behind Roux limb aka Peterson's hernia
