### Notes
- Low [[bioavailability]] due to [[first pass metabolism]]
- Provides if given within 8-10 h of overdose
- [[Anaphylactoid reaction]] can occur
- Vomiting through oral route 
### Indications
- Serum acetaminophen level above the treatment line in [[Rumack-Matthew nomogram]] when measured 4 hours after ingestion
- Single ingestion of acetaminophen > 150 mg/kg (7.5 g irrespective of patient weight) if the acetaminophen level cannot be assessed within 8 hours of ingestion
- History of acetaminophen ingestion with signs of liver injury 
- Reliable history with repeated supra-therapeutic ingesting and concentration â‰¥20 mcg/mL (132 micromol/L) or aminotransferases are elevated
- High serum acetaminophen level (> 10 mcg/mL) with an unknown time of ingestion
- History of acetaminophen ingestion and any evidence of liver injury
### Dosage
- Acetylcysteine is most effective at preventing liver injury if started within eight hours of an acute ingestion; however, acetylcysteine provides benefit at any time after ingestion, even if there is no acetaminophen still present in serum.
- Whichever protocol is chosen, it should deliver at least 300 mg/kg acetylcysteine during the first 20 to 24 hours of treatment.

| Oral protocol<br><br>                    | A loading dose of 140 mg/kg orally, followed by<br>A dose of 70 mg/kg orally every four hours until stopping criteria are met |                         |
### Stopping Criteria for Acetylcysteine Treatment
- All of the following criteria should be met to stop the regimen 

| Criteria                          | Value                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimum Dose Administered         | 300 mg/kg over 20 to 24 hours                                                   |
| Serum Acetaminophen Concentration | <10 mcg/mL (66 micromol/L)                                                      |
| INR                               | <2.0                                                                            |
| ALT and AST                       | Normal or decreased by 25-50% from peak, or at baseline if chronically abnormal |
| Clinical Condition                | Patient is clinically well (e.g., no nausea/vomiting, no abdominal pain)        |
- If all of these criteria are not met, we continue acetylcysteine at a rate of at least 6.25 mg/kg/hour (or 70 mg/kg every four hours orally). 
- After 12 hours, we re-evaluate the patient and repeat the ALT, AST, INR, and acetaminophen concentration to see if these stopping criteria are met.
### Contraindications
- If hepatic failure occurs, it is not recommended
