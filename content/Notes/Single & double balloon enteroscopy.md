| Double Balloon Endoscopy (DBE)                                                                                                        | Single Balloon Endoscopy (SBE)                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requires a 2-person procedure, with an endoscopist and an assistant                                                                   | Requires a similar technique to DBE but with some differences                                                             |
| Soft latex balloon attached to the tip of the enteroscope                                                                             | Utilizes the flexible tip of the enteroscope for anchoring instead of a balloon                                           |
| Balloons are inflated and deflated at various stages of the procedure for anchoring and advancement                                   | Overtube is backloaded onto the enteroscope, and the enteroscope is anchored using its flexible tip                       |
| Procedure involves antegrade and retrograde approaches for complete enteroscopy                                                       | Similar to DBE, aims for complete enteroscopy, but with differences in technique                                          |
| Allows for endoscopic evaluation of the entire small bowel with a single approach or by combining antegrade and retrograde approaches | The entire apparatus is advanced through the small intestine using pleating technique                                     |
| Previously performed with fluoroscopic guidance, although less commonly used now                                                      | Technique involves advancing and retracting the apparatus while keeping the overtube balloon inflated to prevent slippage |
| Requires colonoscopy preparation for retrograde approach                                                                              | Final enteroscope advancement can be marked with a submucosal tattoo                                                      |
| DBE uses a specially coupled enteroscope and overtube apparatus with latex balloons mounted on the distal ends of each component      | Utilizes overtube with balloon only, while the enteroscope has a working length, outer diameter, and working channel      |
| Balloons intended to anchor the endoscope during insertion to allow for pleating of the bowel over the endoscope shaft                | Balloon pressure in SBE is regulated to 5.4 kPa                                                                           |
