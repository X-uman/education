- Potato tumor
- Non chromaffin [[Paraganglioma]]
- chemodectoma
- Rare tumor <0.5%
- Can be malignant in 10% of cases

### Risk Factors
- Persistent [[Hypoxia]] due to high attitude or [[Cyanotic Heart defects]] leading to stimulation of Carotid body
### Presentation
- more common in middle aged females
- Unilateral mass in Anterior triangle of neck
- Compression of adjacent structures causing
	- Dysphagia: Esophagus
	- [[Horner Syndrome]]: Sympathetic chain
	- Tinnitus/Hearing loss: Blood supply to cochlear nerve
	- Syncope: Internal carotid artery
- Flushing: if it is a [[Catecholamines]] secreting tumor
- Palpation 
	- **Potato** firm consistency
	- Mobile side to side but not up and down: ==Fontaine sign==
	- Transmitted [[Pulsatile mass]]

### investigations 
- [[CT-scan]] or [[MRI]] features 
	- Soft enhancing tissue mass at the bifuraction
	- ==Lyre's sign==: Â Splaying of Carotid vessels at junction as tumor grows
	- Calcification: In rare cases, calcification can be seen in the tumor on CT scan.
- IOC: Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) or Doppler ultrasound, 
	- the tumor can appear as a ==flow void== due to the increased blood flow in the feeding vessels.
- contraindications: FNAC due to risk of bleeding

### management 
==Shamblin Classification==

| Classification | Degree of Adherence to Artery | Surgical Approach                                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class I        | <25%                          | Excision of tumor                                                               |
| Class II       | ~50%                          | Excision with 3-point control (2 branches and the main carotid artery)          |
| Class III      | Encasing artery               | Resect Common Carotid Artery (CCA)<br> Use Internal Jugular Vein (IJV) as graft |


- Post-operative radiotherapy in malignant tumor

### complications of surgery 
- commonest nerve injured: Superior Laryngeal Nerve
- ==First bite syndrome==: Due to damage of sympathetic nerve fibers surrounding carotid and reinnervation by Parasympathetic branches: Pain in neck while eating
