## before u start
- [[Antepartum hemorrhage]] 
- [[Post-partum hemorrhage]]
- Placenta is broad and deep and ahead of the fetus, along with cord


## how it all started
- [[Threatened abortion]]
- [[Placenta membranaceae]] 
- [[Multiparity]]: e.g. [[Grand multipara]]
- [[multiple gestation]]
- [[Scarred uterus]]


## then what?
- Inadequate decidual reaction: leads to [[Placenta accreta spectrum]]
- When [[lower uterine segment]] starts to expand during later stages [[shear force]] develops between it and placenta, leading to inevitable bleeding mostly maternal
	- Painless bright red (compare [[placental abruption]])


## little further down the rabbit hole 
- [[vasa previa]] 
- placental compression is impaired in Posterior PP, so high risk of ? 
- [[cord compression]]
- [[Umbilical cord prolapse]]
- [[Unstable lie]] due to lack of [[Engagement]] 
- [[Stallworthy's sign]]: [[Fetal head compression]] into pelvis leads to deceleration in posterior type 
- [[Post-partum hemorrhage]]: [[primary hemostasis]] cannot happen, i.e. [[Living ligature]] cannot set in 

## they might confuse u
- PP in early pregnancy, placenta comes up

## what shall u do as a doctor
- [[Placentography]] 
- Do not attempt [[PV examination]] after warning bleeding
- [[Color flow doppler USG]]: To rule out morbidly adherent placenta
- [[Macafee and Johnson regimen]]
