### Clinical features
- Scurvy: clinical manifestation of vitamin C deficiency, which leads to impaired collagen synthesis and easily damaged connective tissue
- In scurvy, there is defective formation of connective tissues and collagen in skin, cartilage, dentine, bone, and blood vessels, leading to their fragility. In the long bones, osteoid is not deposited by osteoblasts, cortex is thin, and the trabeculae become brittle and fracture easily.

- Skin
	- Follicular hyperkeratosis, perifollicular hemorrhage, coiled “corkscrew” hair
	- [[delayed wound healing]] 
	 - [[mucocutaneous bleeding]] 
	- The hemorrhagic skin lesions are initially flat but may coalesce and become palpable, especially on the lower extremities. This finding may resemble a systemic vasculitis.

- Bone 
	- Subperiosteal hemorrhage, [[hemarthrosis]]
	- Arthralgia: Joint Swelling and tenderness most pronounced in Knees and Ankles
	- [[Pseudoparalysis]] 
	- Musculoskeletal pain
	- Scorbutic Rosary
- Teeth
	- Mucosal bleeding,
	- Gingivitis, swollen gums
	- The gingival swelling and dusky color just above two of the teeth indicate hemorrhage into the gums of this patient with poor dentition. 
	- The gingival abnormalities of scurvy occur only in the presence of teeth, which presumably provide portals of entry for microbes into the gums. 
	- One hypothesis suggests that vitamin C deficiency impairs neutrophil-mediated killing of bacteria, leading to chronic gingivitis, which is then complicated by bleeding from the fragile vessels characteristic of scurvy.

- Blood
- Signs of anemia (fatigue, paleness) 
	- Normocytic anemia: decreased iron absorption in the small intestine, Vitamin C
	- Macrocytic anemia: decreased conversion of folate into its active metabolite
- Poor immune response

### Diagnostics
- Vitamin C levels
##### Radiological Findings

### Treatment of Vitamin C deficiency
- 100-200 mg daily for 3 months for complete recovery

### Prevention:
- Breastfeeding
- In formula, fortification necessary
- Antenatal supplementation in smoking mothers
- Supplementation in children taking restrictive diet, malnourished and chronic illnesses like Malignancies, Neurological diseases
Vitamin C deficiency results in sCurvy due to impaired Collagen synthesis.
