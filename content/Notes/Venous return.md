### Mechanism
- Negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration
- The pressure within the calf compartment rises to 200â€“300mmHg during muscle contraction
- During muscle relaxation, the pressure falls and further blood from the superficial veins enters the deep vein.
- The net reduction in the pressure of the superficial system is dependent on the presence of a pressure gradient between the leg and the thorax and a patent and compliant venous system containing competent valves.
- An absence of one or more of these results in [[venous hypertension]], which leads to further vein wall damage including loss of compliance, thickening, dilatation and valvular dysfunction. This venous damage goes on to reduce the function of the affected veins, worsening the venous hypertension in a vicious cycle
