### Introduction

### Types
- [[Necrotizing fasciitis]]
- [[Necrotizing myositis]]
- [[Necrotizing cellulitis]]
### Risk factors
- Major penetrating trauma
- Minor laceration of blunt trauma
- Skin breach like Varicella lesion, insect bite
- Recent surgery
- Mucosal breach
- [[immunocompromised status]]
	- [[Diabetes Mellitus]] is a particularly important risk factor for necrotizing infection involving the lower extremities, perineum, and head and neck region
- In women: Pregnancy, childbirth,  [[Pregnancy loss]] 

### Presentation
- Features of inflammation
	- Erythema
	- Edema
	- Severe pain
- Complications due to inflammation
	- Firm and indurated subcutaneous tissue, hindering distinct palpation of underlying muscle groups
	- Edema can cause [[Compartment syndrome]] 
	- Skin color changes from red-purple to patches of blue-gray within three to five days
	- Skin breakdown with bullae containing thick pink or purple fluid
	- Skin bullae, necrosis, or ecchymosis
	- Frank cutaneous gangrene development
- Systemic findings
	- Fever
- NSTI can be difficult to diagnose if
	- No fever
	- Absence of cutaneous manifestations
	- Attribution of severe pain to alternative cause
	- Radiographic imaging may demonstrate edema with no gas in the deep tissue
	- Attributing systemic manifestations to other causes â€“ Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may be early manifestations of toxemia due to group A streptococcal infection but may be wrongly attributed to other conditions

### Diagnostics
- Patients with suspected NSTI (1/3)
	- Crepitus, skin discoloration, thin, foul smelling wound discharge
	- Rapid progression of clinical manifestations
	- Severe pain out of proportion to skin findings 
- Blood cultures are positive in approximately 60 percent of patients with monomicrobial (type II) necrotizing fasciitis (eg, due to GAS or other beta-hemolytic streptococci) and are routinely positive in patients with necrotizing myositis
| Type   | Blood culture | Additional notes               |
| Type 1 | ~20%          | May not reflect all organisms  |
| Type 2 | ~60%          | Routinely positive in Myositis |
#### Tissue diagnosis
- Immediate surgical exploration is crucial to confirm necrotizing infection, assess tissue involvement, and remove devitalized tissue.
- Do not delay surgical exploration, even if awaiting diagnostic results, when suspecting necrotizing infection.
- Radiographic imaging studies can be useful to help determine whether necrotizing infection is present but should not delay surgical intervention when there is crepitus on examination or rapid progression of clinical manifestations
##### Findings
- swollen and dull-gray appearance of the fascia, thin exudate without clear purulence, and easy separation of tissue planes by blunt dissection
- Thrombosis of the underlying dermal capillary network is apparent and precedes overt skin necrosis; incision through involved areas will not bleed normally.
- Soft tissue involvement often extends beyond margins based solely on external appearance

#### Imaging
- CT is preferred modality of imaging
- Findings
	- Gas in soft tissues which is most frequently seen in the setting of clostridial infection or Polymicrobial NF: High specific for NSTI and should prompt immediate surgical exploration
	- fluid collections, absence or heterogeneity of tissue enhancement with intravenous contrast, and inflammatory changes beneath the fascia
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not as useful as CT for detection of gas in soft tissues. In addition, MRI can be overly sensitive; it tends to overestimate deep tissue involvement and therefore cannot be used to reliably distinguish between necrotizing cellulitis and deeper infection

### Management
- Surgical emergency 
- Aggressive [[Surgical debridement]] until healthy, viable (bleeding) tissue is reached
- Severe infection: [[Amputation]] 
- Empirical Antibiotics
	- [[Carbapenems]] or Piperacillin-Tazobactam PLUS
	- Agent with activity against [[MRSA]] PLUS
	- [[Clindamycin]] 
	- If resistance to Clindamycin: [[Linezolid]] or Tedizolid
- Antibiotics should be continued until no further debridement is needed and the patient's hemodynamic status has normalized, this duration often consists of at least two weeks of treatment and must be tailored to individual patient circumstances
- Hemodynamic instability may require aggressive supportive care with fluids and vasopressors. 
- [[Toxic shock syndrome]] 

### Prevention
- Post-exposure prophylaxis for [[immunocompromised status]] or recent surgery
- Penicillin (250 mg orally 4 times daily) for 10 days

### Prognosis
##### Factors associated with increased mortality 
- White blood cell count >30,000/microL; band neutrophils >10 percent
- Serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (177 mmol/L)
- Age >60 years
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome
- Clostridial infection
- Delay in surgery for more than 24 hours
- Infection involving the head, neck, thorax, or abdomen

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Cellulitis]]: generally not associated with hemodynamic instability or exquisite tenderness
- [[Pyoderma gangrenosum]] 
	- The distinction is important because inappropriate surgical debridement of pyoderma gangrenosum can cause extension of the lesion, and inappropriate administration of immunosuppressive therapy may worsen necrotizing fasciitis.
- [[Gas gangrene]] 
	- Both gas gangrene and polymicrobial (type I) NSTI are associated with gas in the tissues. In gas gangrene, the Gram stain typically demonstrates gram-positive rods, while, in polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, the Gram stain typically demonstrates mixed aerobes and anaerobes
	- The distinction is important in that management of clostridial myonecrosis may require amputation, whereas management of necrotizing fasciitis requires debridement (but limb salvage may be possible).
