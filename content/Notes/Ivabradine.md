- A drug that decreases the funny current in pacemaker cells by blocking the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. It decreases myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate in a dose-dependent manner but it does not affect heart contractility.
- it is used to treat chronic stable angina in patients who cannot take beta blockers, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
### Indications
- Patients with NYHA II–III HFrEF and all of the following: 
	- Stable LVEF ≤ 35%
	- Maximum tolerated first-line GDMT that includes a beta blocker
	- Sinus rhythm with HR of ≥ 70 bpm at rest
