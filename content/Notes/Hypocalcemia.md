### Management
- In children with symptomatic hypocalcemia (including seizures or tetany), one or more intravenous boluses of calcium gluconate may be necessary, at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg of elemental calcium (maximum single dose 540 mg) administered slowly and intravenously over 5 to 10 minutes (1 to 2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate), followed by a slow infusion of calcium in patients with persistent hypocalcemia
