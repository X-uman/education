### Physiology
- Synthesis begins at 20 WOG
- Mature surfactant in adequate amount is present > 35 WOG 
- Surfactant appears in amniotic fluid in 28-32 WOG 
- [[Cortisol]] stimulates labor and makes fetus ready to breath outside
### Assessment of FLM
- [[Lecithin: Sphingomyelin Ratio]] 
- Shake test
	- Mixture of Amniotic fluid and ethyl alcohol is taken in a test tube 
	- At least 1 complete ring of bubbles on surface indicates mature surfactant
- Nile blue sulfatase test
- Phosphatidyl glycerol level estimation

### Management

| Indications  | POG        | Criteria                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All patients | 24-34 WOG  | - Initial course: all patients at risk of delivery within 7 days                                 |
|              |            | - Second course: patients at risk of delivery within 7 days whose prior course was > 14 days ago |
| Patients     | 34- 36 6/7 | - Steroids not previously given                                                                  |
|              |            | - No evidence of [[chorioamnionitis]]                                                            |
|              |            | - Delivery anticipated between 24 hours and 7 days                                               |

- Rationale of using [[Glucocorticoids]] 
	- [[Hyaline membrane disease]] 
	- [[Intraventricular hemorrhage]]
	- [[periventricular leukomalacia]]
	- [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] in infants born between 23 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7 weeks of gestation
- Prevent  [[Prematurity or preterm birth|premature birth]] if possible. [[Tocolytics]] 

#### Regimen
- Antenatal corticosteroid therapy administered to the mother (stimulates infant lung maturation)
	   - Given 48 hours before delivery
	   - 2 doses of IM betamethasone 12mg 24 hours apart or 
	   - 4 doses of IM dexamethasone 6mg 12 hours apart
- Injection betamethasone has slightly higher neuroprotective effect 
- **Rescue course**: Prior course >7 days from last dose
