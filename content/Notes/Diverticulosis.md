- False diverticulum > True diverticulum in GIT
- False: Acquired, Localized in Sigmoid colon
- True: Congenital, MC in Cecum 

### Pathophysiology
- [[Laplace's law]] 
- Increased intraluminal pressure ([[Dietary Risk factors]])
- Weakness of Intestinal Wall
	- Old age
	- [[Connective Tissue Disease]]
	- [[Polycystic Kidney disease]]: Autosomal dominant type

### Presentation
- Diverticulosis is the commonest cause of [[Lower GI Bleeding]] 
- Common site is [[Sigmoid colon]] because it is narrowest part of colon and has high intraluminal pressures
- **Painless** [[per rectal bleeding]], painful may be due to [[Ischemic Colitis]] 
	- Possible signs of Anemia
	- Sometimes severe/ongoing: Unstable vitals
	- 70-80%: Spontaneous cessation of bleeding 
- Features similar to [[Irritable bowel syndrome]]: constipation, diarrhea 
- Colicky LLQ pain
- Asymptomatic to fulminant presentations 

### Diagnosis
- [[Colonoscopy]] is Investigation of Choice 
- If [[Notes/Diverticulitis|Diverticulitis]] suspected, [[CT-scan]] with IV Contrast is preferred 
- [[Barium study]] shows diverticula
- [[USG]] 

### Complications 
- [[Lower GI Bleeding]]: Commonest cause is Diverticulosis 
- [[Diverticulitis]] 
- Chronic inflammation: [[Diverticular disease associated colitis]] 
- [[Abscess]]
- [[Peritonitis]]
- [[bowel obstruction]]
- [[hemorrhage]]
- [[Sinuses and Fistulae]]
 - Colovesical fistula is commonest 
- [[Psoas abscess]] 
- Differentiate from [[Angiodysplasia]] 
### Management
- Asymptomatic: Prevent progression
	- Diet, Weight, Physical activity, Smoking & alcohol cessation
- Ongoing bleeding
	- Perform endoscopic hemostasis 
	- Angiography with vessel embolization 
- Complicated: treat complications
