### Pathophysiology
- Higher hemoglobin levels in neonates due to hypoxic environment inside uterine cavity
- Shorter life span of RBCs 
- During the first three months, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is replaced by adult hemoglobin (HbA); as a result, bilirubin levels rise and hemoglobin levels drop to 10–13 g/dL. 
- Ineffective erythropoiesis in neonates
- Ineffective carrier mediated uptake of bilirubin by liver
- Immature UDP Glucouronyl transferase activity
- Increased [[Enterohepatic circulation]]: Low concentration of bacteria in neonatal digestive tracts → less bilirubin is reduced to urobilinogen and excreted → unconjugated bilirubin is reabsorbed and recycled into the circulation 
### Criteria
- Jaundice appears after 24 h of birth
- Total bilirubin rises by < 5 mg/dl/day
- Peak bilirubin at 3-5 days 
- Total bilirubin at peak < 15 mg/dl (i.e. below threshold for [[Phototherapy]], so does not require treatment)
- Clinical jaundice resolves by 1 week in term and 2 weeks in preterm infants
