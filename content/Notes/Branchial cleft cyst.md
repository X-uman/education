### Introduction
- remnants of the embryological second branchial cleft or cervical sinus, which normally regresses before birth

---
### Etiology


---
### Pathogenesis
- formed due to incomplete obliteration of branchial clefts and pouches

----
### Epidemiology
- Accounts for ∼ 20% of pediatric neck masses
- ∼ 95% of all branchial cleft malformations are anomalies of the second branchial cleft.
- M = F 

---
### Presentation
- usually diagnosed in late childhood or in adulthood after a previously undiagnosed cyst becomes infected
- History of upper respiratory infection
- Painless, firm mass (painful if infected)
	- Located lateral to the midline, usually anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in upper third 
	- Does not move with swallowing
	- Smooth, flat, fluctuant and often transilluminant with a sensation of 'half filled hot water bottle'
- There may be a small draining opening if a fistula is present.
#### Clinical signs

### Diagnostics
- FNAC: Cholesterol crystals
- Lined by Squamous epithelium with plenty of lymphoid tissue 
- USG: Round mass with uniform low echogenicity and no internal septations



---
### Management
- Treatment: complete surgical excision of both the cyst and any associated tracts
- Careful dissection to avoid carotid artery, hypoglossal nerve, Glossopharyngeal nerve, spinal accessory nerve, posterior belly of digastric, tonsils and pharyngeal wall

### Complications


---
- [[Pharyngeal arches]] 
- [[Branchial fistula]]
