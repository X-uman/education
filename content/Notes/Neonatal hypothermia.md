### Definiition
- Normal temperature: 36.5-37.5 C
- Axillary temperature < 36.5 C in a neonate, after measuring for ~3 minutes
- Classification
	- Cold stress: 36-36.4 (soles are cold to touch)
	- Moderate: 32-36
	- Severe: < 32
- Temperature of non-asphyxiated neonate is a strong predictor of [[neonatal mortality]] at all gestational age

### Pathophysiology
- High body surface area compared to B.W.
- Heat loss takes place via
	- Radiation
	- Conduction
	- Convection
- Less subcutaneous fat especially in 
	- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]]
	- [[Small for gestational age]]
	- [[IUGR]]
- Shivering reflex is absent in neonates 
- Protective mechanisms against hypothermia
	- Non-shivering thermogenesis from [[brown fat]] which are lipid deposits richer in mitochondria
	- Release of [[Noradrenaline]] uncouples [[Fatty acids Oxidation]] which generates heat 
	- Cutaneous vasoconstriction
	- Flexed posture
	- Higher heart rate: more heat generation

### Presentation
- Acidosis, Hypoglycemia, Hypoxemia
- [[Multiorgan dysfunction]]

### Prevention
- 'Warm chain' to prevent hypothermia
	- delivery room should be warm ~25 C
	- Warm [[Neonatal resuscitation]]
	- Immediate drying
	- Skin to skin contact
	- Early [[Breastfeeding]] 
	- Postpone bathing
	- 'Rooming in' 
	- Warm transportation
- Devices 
	- Radiant warmer: heat loss still can occur by convection current
	- Incubator: heating is through Convection, but still heat loss can be lost by radiation
