- Reduces threshold for [[Seizures]] 

### Complications
- [[Trauma-associated coagulopathy]] 
	- Acidosis (excess protons) interferes with the assembly of coagulation factor complexes involving calcium and negatively charged phospholipids (clustered as "rafts" on the surfaces of platelets, cells expressing tissue factor, and damaged endothelial cells). As a result, the activity of the factor Xa/Va prothrombinase complex at a pH of 7.2, 7.0, and 6.8 is reduced by 50, 70, and 80 percent, respectively
