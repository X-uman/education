### Etiologies
1. **Carpal Tunnel:** This is the most common site of compression. The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist, along with tendons and other structures.
2. **Pronator Teres:** The median nerve may be compressed as it passes through the pronator teres muscle in the forearm.
3. **Anterior Interosseous Nerve:** Compression can occur at the anterior interosseous nerve branch of the median nerve, typically in the forearm.
4. **Cubital Fossa:** While less common, the median nerve can be compressed at the elbow in the cubital fossa, where it can become entrapped between the two heads of the pronator teres muscle.
5. **Supracondylar Process:** Rarely, the median nerve may be compressed by the supracondylar process of the humerus, an anatomical variant.
6. **Arcade of Struthers:** Another rare site of compression is the arcade of Struthers, a fibrous band extending from the medial head of the triceps muscle to the medial intermuscular septum.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome
- Can it be considered a chronic [[Compartment syndrome]] which affects [[Median nerve]]

| Excessive tissue matrix          | [[Amyloidosis]]                                                                                  |

### Tests for CTS
- Tinel's Test
- Phalen Test for 1 min 
- Tourniquet test
- Durkan Carpal Compression Test for 30 sec (Highest sensitivity/specificity)
- Hand elevation test 
- Grip and Pinch Strength: decreased
- Hand Diagram
- Night Pain
- Semmes Weinstein monofilament Test 

- [[Carpal tunnel Anatomy]] 
- [[Nerve function tests]] 

### Presentation
- [[Median nerve]] 
- Often Bilateral asymmetric symptoms  
- Weak grip: Dropping objects
- Clumsiness 
- Usually no loss of Sensation on skin overlying [[Thenar muscles]] because it is supplied by superficial branch of MN which arises 5-7cm Proximal to Carpal tunnel
- No loss of sensation in central part of hand 
- Thenar atrophy 

### Investigations
- USG
	- Bowed [[Flexor retinaculum]] towards palmar direction
	- Proximal Enlargement (Most sensitive and specific) due to axonal stasis? 
	- and distal flattening of median nerve
- MRI/CT have lower sensitivity
- MRI well suited for soft tissue changes 

#### Differential Diagnosis

| Syndrome                                 | Differentiating Features from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Anterior interosseous nerve syndrome]] | Involves motor deficits, particularly affecting the flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger, and pronator quadratus muscles. Sensory deficits are not typical.                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Pronator teres syndrome]]              | Characterized by pain and weakness in the forearm and hand, with symptoms exacerbated by pronation. There may be tenderness over the pronator teres muscle, and symptoms often radiate to the wrist and hand. Sensory deficits may not be prominent.                                                                                         |
| [[Kienbock disease]]                     | Primarily affects the lunate bone in the wrist, leading to avascular necrosis and subsequent wrist pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. It does not typically involve compression of nerves in the carpal tunnel.                                                                                                                    |
| [[Cubital tunnel syndrome]]              | Involves compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, leading to symptoms such as numbness and tingling in the ring and little fingers, weakness in hand grip, and muscle wasting in the hand. Symptoms may worsen with elbow flexion.                                                                                                       |
| [[Cervical Disc Herniation]]             | Arises from compression of spinal nerves in the neck due to herniation of intervertebral discs. Symptoms can include pain, numbness, and weakness in the neck, shoulders, arms, and hands, often with associated neck stiffness or reduced range of motion.                                                                                  |
| [[Thoracic inlet Syndrome]]              | Also known as "Pancoast syndrome," it involves compression of nerves or blood vessels as they pass through the thoracic inlet, typically due to tumors or other structural abnormalities in the upper chest. Symptoms can include shoulder pain, arm pain, and weakness, often with associated Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis). |
| Proximal compression                     | This is a general term encompassing various conditions where nerves are compressed proximal to the wrist, such as brachial plexus compression or compression of peripheral nerves in the upper arm. Symptoms depend on the specific nerves involved but may include pain, weakness, and sensory disturbances in the shoulder, arm, or hand.  |
