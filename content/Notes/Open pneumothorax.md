- A pneumothorax due to a traumatic, open chest wall wound that allows air to enter the pleural cavity directly through the wound during inspiration, leading to a collapsed lung on the affected side. If untreated, can lead to tension pneumothorax and respiratory collapse.
- Wound > 2/3rd diameter of trachea or > 3 cm diameter: Air enters lung through wound: Sucking chest wound leading to ineffective ventilation
	- STAT: 3 way valve closure 
	- definite: ICD placement till wound heals
- Immediately apply simple, partially occlusive dressings taped at 3 out of 4 sides of the lesion. 
- Follow dressing with tube thoracostomy. 
- The tube should be placed through intact skin in one of the recommended anatomical locations, not through the preexisting injury.
- Observe for development of tension pneumothorax.
