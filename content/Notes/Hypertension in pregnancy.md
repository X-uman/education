### Etiology
1. Genetic factors including inherited predisposing genes and epigenetic influences.
2. Placental implantation with abnormal trophoblastic invasion of uterine vessels (failure of normal spiral artery remodeling)
3. Immunological maladaptive tolerance between maternal, paternal (placental), and fetal tissues
4. Maternal maladaptation to cardiovascular or inflammatory changes of normal pregnancy

### Pathophysiology
- Placental underperfusion, hypoxia, ischemia, oxidative stress, leading to release of anti-angiogenic factors into the maternal circulation
	- Anti-angiogenic: soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)
	- Angiogenic: placental growth factor (PlGF)
- These factors cause
	- [[Endothelial dysfunction]]
	- [[Atherosis]] in placental vessels
	- Vasospasm and increased pressure 
	- [[Starling laws]]: Transudation
- [[Reperfusion injury]] like condition occurring from ischemic placenta inciting [[SIRS]] and vasospasm
- Altered [[cerebral perfusion]] in pregnancy decreases threshold of failure of autoregulation 
- [[Pre-eclampsia-Pathophysiology.jpg]] 
## Clinical Features
- All organs are involved leading to variety of clinical features
##### Systemic
- [[Korotkoff Sounds]]: Phase V is used to define diastolic pressure
- A sudden rise in mean arterial pressure later in pregnancy—also known as “delta hypertension”—may also signify preeclampsia even if blood pressure is < 140/90 mm Hg

This maldevelopment of the uteroplacental circulation can result in reduced placental perfusion, leading to placental infarcts, villous hypoplasia, and, in some cases, the clinical sequelae of FGR. |


### Management
##### Symptomatic
- [[Anti-hypertensive drugs in pregnancy]] 
- [[Magnesium Sulfate for seizure prophylaxis]]  
- Intensive [[Fluids]] are not indicated for oliguria unless diminished urine output is from [[hemorrhage]] or fluid loss from vomiting or fever.

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] is sometimes confused with preeclampsia. It too has onset in late pregnancy, often there is accompanying hypertension, abnormal liver tests, and [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]]  
- Most pregnant patients with hypertension and thrombocytopenia and/or elevated transaminases have preeclampsia with severe features; 
- alternative diagnoses to consider include 
	- HELLP syndrome, 
	- acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), 
	- [[microvascular thrombosis]] (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS]), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

### Prevention and Screening
- Screening for traditional risk factors for preeclampsia 
- [[Aspirin in preeclampsia]] at low dose throughout pregnancy for patients with high risk
- Regular ANC visits
- **Calcium supplementation**:  In populations with low calcium intake, the World Health Organization recommends 1500 to 2000 mg elemental calcium supplementation per day for pregnant individuals to reduce the risk of preeclampsia, particularly those at higher risk of developing hypertension
- Prepregnancy weight loss and appropriate [[Gestational weight gain]] 
- Timed birth at 39 weeks
- Exercise 
- [[Anti-oxidants]] are not found to be useful 
- Prostacyclin: Thromboxane A2 ratio decreased
- Anti-oxidants and calcium show no benefits in preeclampsia
### Prediction
- Excessive response to vasopressors
- [[Uterine Artery doppler]] 
- [[Hyperuricemia]]
- [[Microalbuminuria]]  
- [[Delta hypertension]]  
- [[Roll over test]]
