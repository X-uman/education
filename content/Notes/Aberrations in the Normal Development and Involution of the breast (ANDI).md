### Features of ANDI
- Cyst formation
- Fibrosis replaces fat and elastic tissues
- **Adenosis**: hyperplasia of epithelium lining of ducts and acini, with or without hyperplasia
- Papillomatosis due to hyperplasia may occur

##### Disorders of cyclical changes
- Cyclical [[Mastalgia]]: in [[Perimenopause]] 
- Cyclical Nodularity
##### Disorders of involution

| Lobular Involution    | Diffuse cystic mastopathy/fibrocystic changes <br>   - [[Non-proliferative fibrocystic changes]] <br>   - [[Proliferative fibrocystic changes]] |
| Ductal Involution     | - [[Ductal ectasia]]                                                                                                                            |
