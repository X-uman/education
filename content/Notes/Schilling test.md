### Introduction
- a test to determine the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency
- Consists of four stages that assess impaired vitamin B12 uptake (see table below) 
- Patients ingest radiolabelled vitamin B12 and then its urinary excretion is measured after 24 h 
- Urinary excretion of 8â€“40% (varies between laboratories) of radioactive vitamin B12 within 24 hours is considered normal. 
- No longer routinely used in clinical practice
### Stages

| Stages | Description                                                          | Normal excretion                   | Decreased excretion |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1      | Oral radioactive B12 + IM unlabeled B12 to saturate depots after 1 h | Malnutrition/increased demand      | Go to Stage 2       |
| 2      | Oral rB12 + IF                                                       | Malabsorption due to IF deficiency | Go to Stage 3       |
| 3      | Oral rB12 + Antibiotics                                              | Bacterial overgrowth               | Go to Stage 4       |
| 4      | Oral rB12 + [[Pancreatic enzymes]]                                   | [[pancreatic insufficiency]]       |                     |
