### Classification
#### Simple pneumothorax
- Rupture of bulla/cavity
- Sometimes associated with [[Pleural effusion]]: Hydropneumothorax
- ICD is enough
- [[Open vs closed pneumothorax.png]]
### Other types
- [[Tension Pneumothorax]] 
- [[Open pneumothorax]] 
- [[Traumatic pneumothorax]] 

### Severity of Pneumothorax
#### Stable vs unstable patients
| Parameter                           | Normal Range/Condition          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Respiratory Rate                    | Less than 24 breaths per minute |
| Heart Rate                          | 60-120 beats per minute         |
| Blood Pressure                      | Normal (not defined)            |
| Room Air Oxygen Saturation          | Greater than 90 percent         |
| Ability to Speak in Whole Sentences | Present                         |

### Diagnostics
- Unstable: [[eFAST]] or [[FAST scan]] 
- Stable: Bedside Chest X-ray 
- Chest radiography may not be needed if patients are undergoing chest CT for another indication (eg, stable patients with trauma undergoing total body CT for additional injuries or patients with suspected pulmonary embolism undergoing CT pulmonary angiography).

### Management 
- [[Pneumothorax management]] 
### Complications
- Complete pulmonary collapse → [[Respiratory failure]] 
- Tension pneumothorax → [[Obstructive shock]] 
- Mediastinal flutter in open pneumothorax  → hemodynamic shock
- Hemothorax in cases of trauma
- Pneumomediastinum
- Pneumoperitoneum
- Recurrence 
- Post-surgical/procedural complications
	- Persistent fistula with continuous air leak
	- Injury to intercostal nerves and vessels
	- Infection

- Hydropneumothorax
- Pneumothorax ex vacuo 
- simultaneous bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces
