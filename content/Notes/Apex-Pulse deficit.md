- Pulse deficit: the difference between the pulse rate (measured by cardiac auscultation) and the peripheral pulse rate (obtained by palpating the radial artery for 1 minute)
- Possible causes
    - Pulse deficit > 10/min: atrial fibrillation
    - Pulse deficit < 10/min: premature ventricular contractions
    - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)
