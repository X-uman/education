The Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) Score is a clinical grading scale used to predict the prognosis and mortality risk of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. It is calculated based on several factors, with the total score ranging from 0 to 6. A higher ICH Score indicates a worse prognosis.

### ICH Score Calculation
The ICH Score is based on five factors:
1. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Score**
2. **Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH)**
3. **Volume of Hemorrhage**
4. **Infratentorial Origin of Hemorrhage**
5. **Age**

### Scoring Criteria

| **Parameter** | **Score** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **GCS Score** |           |                 |
| 13-15         | 0         | Mild impairment |
| 5-12          | 1         | Moderate impairment |
| 3-4           | 2         | Severe impairment |
| **Presence of IVH** |     |                 |
| No            | 0         | No intraventricular hemorrhage |
| Yes           | 1         | Presence of intraventricular hemorrhage |
| **ICH Volume** |          |                 |
| <30 mL        | 0         | Small volume hemorrhage |
| ≥30 mL        | 1         | Large volume hemorrhage |
| **Infratentorial Origin** | |                 |
| No            | 0         | Supratentorial hemorrhage |
| Yes           | 1         | Infratentorial (cerebellar or brainstem) hemorrhage |
| **Age**       |           |                 |
| <80 years     | 0         | Younger patients |
| ≥80 years     | 1         | Older patients |

### Total ICH Score
- The total ICH Score is the sum of the points for each parameter.
- The score ranges from 0 to 6.

### Interpretation
- **0**: Best prognosis, lowest risk of mortality.
- **1-2**: Intermediate prognosis, moderate risk of mortality.
- **3-6**: Poor prognosis, high risk of mortality.

### Example Calculation
A 75-year-old patient with a GCS score of 10, no intraventricular hemorrhage, a hemorrhage volume of 40 mL, and a supratentorial hemorrhage:
- GCS score: 1 point
- IVH: 0 points
- Hemorrhage volume: 1 point
- Infratentorial origin: 0 points
- Age: 0 points
**Total ICH Score = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2**
This patient has an intermediate prognosis with a moderate risk of mortality.
The ICH Score helps clinicians assess the severity of intracerebral hemorrhage and make informed decisions regarding patient management and prognosis.
