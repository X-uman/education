### Considerations
- Treatment with EMA-CO should be administered every two to three weeks
- Treatment should be continued until the hCG level becomes undetectable and remains undetectable for three consecutive weeks.
- Finally, we administer at least three courses of EMA-CO after the patient achieves undetectable hCG levels as consolidation therapy to reduce the risk of relapse, which is supported by the limited data.
