### Effects
 - lowers Endothelin ET-1 concentrations.
 - Headaches not responding to traditional analgesia, improves after starting infusion

### Use in pregnancy
| Regimen                   | Dosage                                                                                                                            | Maintainence                                 |

| Intravascular (preferred) | Loading dose: 6 grams Over 15-20 minutes                                                                                          | 2 grams/hour Continuous intravenous infusion |
| IM (Intramuscular)        | Loading dose: 5 grams of a 50% solution Into each buttock (total of 10 grams) <br>May be mixed with 1 mL of xylocaine 2% solution | Maintenance dose: 5 grams every four hours   |


- Intramuscular administration results in more fluctuation in magnesium levels and is associated with more side effects, particularly pain at the injection site
- Patients with kidney impairment should receive a standard loading dose, since their volume of distribution is not altered, but a reduced maintenance dose. 
	- If the serum creatinine is >1.1 and <2.5 mg/dL (110 to 221 micromol/L), we suggest a maintenance dose of 1 g/hour; if the serum creatinine is â‰¥2.5 mg/dL (221 micromol/L) or magnesium toxicity is suspected, we suggest no maintenance dose. 
	- Extreme caution is advised when treating patients with reduced GFR (<30 mL/min). We monitor serum magnesium levels in patients with kidney impairment, in addition to frequent assessment for signs and symptoms of magnesium toxicity.
