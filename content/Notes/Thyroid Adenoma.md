- neoplastic process, functional adenoma which is functional(independent of TSH), produces excessive Thyroid and Thyrotoxicosis, TSH, TRH go down which cause Atrophy of Normal part of Thyroid gland. M=F, Here is Nodular Hyperfunctioning Thyroid, no Auto-Abs directed and TSH-R 

### Classification
- Benign neoplasm derived from follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland
- Proliferate and form discrete, single mass
- Difficult to distinguish from dominant nodules of follicular hyperplasia or from follicular Ca
- Majority–non-functional
- Toxic Adenoma(functional Adenomas)– Thyrotoxicosis, independent of TSH production
### Pathology
- Solitary, spherical, encapsulated and well-demarcated from the surrounding Thyroid parenchyma
- 3cm dia, up to 10cm
- Freshly cut: Adenoma bulges from cut surface
	- Well-defined intact capsule
	- In MNG–no capsule, even if dominant solitary
	- 2º changes--fibrosis, calcification may be present like in MNG
##### Microscopy
-  Uniform appearing follicles that contain colloid
- Little variation in the cell and nuclear morphology
- Rare mitotic figures
- Hallmark–Intact, well-formed capsule encircling the tumor
- Extensive Mitotic activity, areas of necrosis, hypercellularity–carcinoma, search for capsular and/or vascular invasion
- Tumor cells have brightly eosinophilic granular cytoplasm–Oxyphil/Hurthle cells change––> Hurthle cell Adenoma
