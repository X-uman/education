**Refractory ascites** is a condition associated with chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis, where ascites (the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity) cannot be adequately controlled by medical therapy. It is characterized by the following:

1. **Unresponsive to Sodium Restriction and Diuretics:**
   - Ascites persists despite adherence to a sodium-restricted diet (usually less than 2 grams of sodium per day).
   - Standard diuretic therapy, which typically includes spironolactone and furosemide, fails to mobilize the ascitic fluid.

2. **Diuretic-Resistant Ascites:**
   - Ascites does not respond to maximum tolerated doses of diuretics (e.g., 400 mg/day of spironolactone and 160 mg/day of furosemide).

3. **Diuretic-Intractable Ascites:**
   - Ascites cannot be controlled with diuretics due to the development of diuretic-induced complications, such as:
     - Severe electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyponatremia, hyperkalemia).
     - Renal dysfunction (e.g., worsening renal failure).
     - Other side effects preventing the continuation of diuretic therapy.

4. **Frequent Therapeutic Paracentesis:**
   - Patients with refractory ascites often require frequent therapeutic paracentesis (removal of fluid from the abdominal cavity) to relieve symptoms and manage the condition.

Refractory ascites is a marker of advanced liver disease and indicates a poor prognosis. It often necessitates consideration of advanced therapeutic options, such as [[TIPSS]] , liver transplantation, or other supportive measures to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
