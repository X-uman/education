## roots
- [[Effects of progesterone]]
- [[Bile salts]] 
- [[Obstructive jaundice]], not actually obstructive jaundice?
- [[Fat absorption]] 
- [[Azathioprine]] 

## Stem
- Impaired [[Bile salt export pump]] 
- Elevated total serum bile acid level (> 10 mcmol/L) in a patient with pruritus in the second or third trimester (without other causes of pruritus) is diagnostic for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. 
- Elevated transaminases are not required for diagnostic confirmation.
## branches
- [[GGT]] is normal despite Cholestasis, rise is higher in Extrahepatic as compared to intrahepatic cholestasis
- Nocturnal [[pruritus]] in palms/soles, 10% have [[Jaundice]] and [[Steatorrhea]] in second and third trimesters

### Diagnostics
- Elevated total serum bile acid level (> 10 mcmol/L) in a patient with pruritus in the second or third trimester (without other causes of pruritus) is diagnostic for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Elevated transaminases are not required for diagnostic confirmation. [11]
- ↑ Total serum bile acid levels: > 10 micromol
- ↑ ALT, ↑ AST (can be mild or grossly elevated, up to 30 times ULN) ALT is more sensitive than AST for diagnosing cholestasis in pregnancy 
- ↑ ALP
- Normal GGT 
- ↑ Direct bilirubin



### Complications
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]], [[IUGR]], [[IUFD]], [[Fetal distress]], recurrence
- [[Neonatal respiratory depression]] 

### Management 
- Medical management
    - First line: [[ursodeoxycholic acid]] (reduces bile acid levels and pruritus)
	- Consider first-generation antihistamines, e.g., hydroxyzine  for severe pruritus.
	- Administer corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if preterm delivery is anticipated.
- Obstetric management
    - Antenatal surveillance 1–2 times per week 
- Monitor serum bile acid levels regularly.
- Deliver at 36–39 weeks' gestation depending on severity (or at diagnosis if diagnosed at ≥ 37 weeks). 
	- Bile acid levels ≥ 100 mcmol/L, 
		- then Deliver at 36 weeks' gestation. 
		- Consider delivery between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation for severe disease.  E.g., patients with severe intractable pruritus, worsening liver dysfunction, or a history of stillbirth due to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy 
- Bile acid levels between 10 and 100 mcmol/L: Deliver between 36 and 39 weeks' gestation. 
- Continuous fetal monitoring is recommended during labor because of the increased risk of stillbirth.
- Prognosis: The condition is fully reversible postpartum.

### Complications
- [[IUFD]]
- [[IUGR]]
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]]
- [[Preterm labor]]
- [[Meconium stained liquor]]
- [[Neonatal respiratory depression]]
- Recurrence (60-90%)
