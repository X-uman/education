Criteria for severe malaria: ≥ 1 of the following in a patient with proven malaria, whether it is clinical or laboratory

| Clinical features                                                                    | Laboratory features                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General: prostration                                                                 | [[High malaria parasitemia]]                                                          |
| CNS: hallucinations, confusion, impaired consciousness, seizures, coma               | Hypoglycemia: < 40 mg/dL                                                              |
| Cardiac: shock (e.g., hypotension, capillary refill time ≥ 3 seconds), heart failure | Acidosis (with or without lactemia): base deficit > 8 meq/L or bicarbonate < 15 meq/L |
| Pulmonary: respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, ARDS                               | Hyperlactatemia: lactate > 5 meq/L                                                    |
| Renal: flank pain, oliguria, hemoglobinuria, acute kidney injury                     | Acute kidney injury: creatinine > 3 mg/dL or urea > 20 mmol/L                         |
| Gastrointestinal: jaundice                                                           | Hyperbilirubinemia: bilirubin > 3 mg/dL                                               |
| Hematopoietic: significant bleeding                                                  | Severe anemia: < 7 g/dL in adults, < 5 g/dL in children                               |

### Supportive care and monitoring
- Manage fever with acetaminophen, tepid sponging, and/or cooling blankets.
- Treat acute seizures, e.g., with IV or rectal diazepam
- Avoid aggressive fluid replacement and rapid fluid boluses. 
- Rule out superadded bacterial infection: Perform fever workup, e.g., blood cultures.  
- Prevent hypoglycemia: Check blood glucose every 4 hours.  
- Monitor Hb every 6–12 hours and renal function daily.  
- Measure malaria parasitemia on days 7 and 28 to monitor response to therapy. 

### Definitive management
- Start IV artesunate ( 2.4 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 3 doses) immediately.  
- Repeat malaria parasite density after 3rd dose of artesunate.
	-  More than1%: Continue IV artesunate (give IV artesunate at the recommended dose once daily; the maximum total treatment duration is 7 days.)
	- ≤ 1%: Switch to oral antimalarials under specialist guidance, continue IV artesunate if patient cannot tolerate
		- Artemether-lumefantrine (preferred)
		- OR atovaquone-proguanil
		- OR quinidine (in the US; quinine elsewhere)
