Here's the information organized into a table:

| Treatment                      | Non-infectious Tenosynovitis                                                                                               | Infectious Tenosynovitis                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conservative Management**   | - NSAIDs<br>- Splinting (immobilization) of the affected finger for 6 weeks                                                 | - Analgesics and broad spectrum IV antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporins, clindamycin)<br>- Splinting and elevation of the affected finger (to decrease the edema)                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interventions**             | - Single (ultrasound-guided) glucocorticoid injection into the tendon sheath (effective in 90% cases, especially if the tenosynovitis has been present for less than 6 months)<br>- Splitting of the constricting retinaculum/ligament                      | - Surgery: incision and drainage, saline irrigation, and open debridement of necrotic/infected tissue                                                                                    |
