### Etiologies
- Genetic predisposition: ∼ 70% of patients have a positive family history. [5]
- Risk factors: these factors may cause ischemic injury of the palmar fascia with subsequent development of Dupuytren contracture in genetically predisposed individuals [4]
	- Cigarette smoking
	- Recurrent trauma (e.g., use of pneumatic tools used in construction, manual labor)
	- Diabetes
	- Alcohol abuse [6]
	- Liver cirrhosis [6]
- Autoimmunity: There is evidence of T-cell accumulation in the fibrotic tissue from the contracture sites, which suggests a possible autoimmune origin of the disease. [7][8]
### Pathophysiology
- Dupuytren contracture (palmar fibromatosis) is a fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia  [9]
- Injury (trauma/ischemia) to the palmar fascia triggers myofibroblasts → fibroblast proliferation and collagen (collagen type III) deposition  → thickening of the palmar fascia → formation of nodules in the palmar fascia
- The nodules are adherent to the overlying dermis → characteristic puckering of palmar skin [4]
- Nodules progress to form cords in the palmar fascia → flexion contractures  of the palmar fascia
### Clinical features
- The 4th and 5th fingers are most commonly involved  
- Skin puckering near the proximal flexor crease: earliest sign 
- Palmar nodule 
- Palmar cords 
- Flexion contracture of affected fingers 
- Signs of aggressive disease: Garrod nodes which Tender pads over the knuckles
- Other manifestations 
	- [[Plantar fibromatosis]] (Ledderhose disease): a plantar equivalent of Dupuytren contracture characterized by the development of painless, firm nodules on the sole of the foot. 
	- [[Peyronie's disease]] in 8% patients
### Management
Here's the information tabulated:

| Treatment            | Indication                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conservative Therapy | Early disease (skin puckering; nodules) and no functional disability | - Observation: Monitoring without intervention.<br>- Physiotherapy: Exercises to maintain or improve hand function.<br>- Hand splint/brace: Supportive devices to reduce strain on affected tissues.<br>- Intralesional Injections: Corticosteroids (e.g., triamcinolone) or collagenase injections for rapidly progressing disease or painful nodules. |
| Surgery              | Functional disability due to contractures                            | - Fasciotomy: Surgical release of fascia to relieve contractures.<br>- Fasciectomy: Removal of affected fascia to improve hand function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Prognosis            | Variable prognosis                                                   | - Recurrence rates are high, even after surgery (approximately 60%).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
