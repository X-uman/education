#### Description 
- A diagnostic test that measures the ability of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to agglutinate [[platelets]]. 
- Ristocetin is an antibiotic that activates vWF to bind [[glycoprotein Ib]], thereby inducing platelet aggregation. 
- Failure of platelet aggregation after adding ristocetin can be seen in patients with von Willebrand disease and [[Bernard-Soulier syndrome]].
