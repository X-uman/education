### Introduction
- Increased [[Abdominal Compartment]] pressure > 12 mmHg
- Often sudden, rapidly progressive, decreasing venous return to the heart
### Etiology
- Polytrauma
- [[Paralytic ileus]]
- [[bowel obstruction]]
- [[Laparoscopic surgery]] 
- [[Retroperitoneal hematoma]]
- Pancreatitis
- Long standing hernia after reduction into peritoneal cavity
### effects

- Renal: Reduced [[GFR]], diminished perfusion
- CVS: Decreased preload, increased afterload, reduced cardiac output
- Respiratory: Decreased lung compliance, increased airway pressures
- Viscera: diminished perfusion
- [[Intracranial pressure]] raised severely 

### Clinical presentation
- Tense distended abdomen
- Decreased urine output
- Hypotension
- Hypoxia, Hypercapnia
- Decreased venous return
- Bowel ischemia

### Management
- Surgical decompression
