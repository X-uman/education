- Extravasation cyst associated with the sublingual glands due to their higher mucin content in secretions compared to other salivary glands.
- Ranulas can be caused by trauma to the delicate sublingual gland ducts causing them to rupture, with mucin then collecting within the connective tissues to 
- form a cyst.

### Clinical manifestations
- Bluish cystic lesion on a lateral aspect of floor of mouth
- May rupture and get infected
- May damage [[Wharton's duct]]
- May interfere with phonation and swallowing

- management: Extirpation of the ranula, including the sublingual gland

- **Plunging ranula**: [[Retention cyst]] of SM or SL gland extending to Submandibular space: **Bidigital palpation**
- management Intraoral excision of Cyst + Gland
	- [[Marsupialisation]] is obsolete
