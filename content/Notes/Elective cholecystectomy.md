## Indications
• Symptomatic [[cholelithiasis]]
• Asymptomatic cholelithiasis with any of the following:
	• Increased risk of [[Biliary carcinoma]] (e.g., [[Gallbladder polyp]], [[porcelain gallbladder]], gallstones ≥ 3 cm)
	• Increased risk of developing complications (e.g., immunocompromised patients, multiple [[Cholelithiasis]]) 
	• Increased risk of becoming symptomatic (e.g., hemolytic anemia, patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery) 

• Contraindication: suspected gallbladder cancer (see ''Treatment'' in “Biliary cancer”) 

• Preoperative precautions: Assess for [[predictors of choledocholithiasis]] in all symptomatic patients (see ''Diagnosis of choledocholithiasis”). 
 
• Timing: as early as possible in uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis 

• Complications: See “[[Cholecystectomy]]” section for details.
