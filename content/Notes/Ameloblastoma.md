- Benign, odontogenic, epithelial tumor
- [[Locally invasive tumors]]
- Infiltrates cancellous bone but not cortical bone 
- Origin: Enamel organ
- Incidence: Mandible >> Maxilla (5:1), 
	- in Maxilla: Posterior Maxilla, 
	- in mandible: Molar Ramus region
- May be Central/Peripheral
	- Peripheral (extra-osseous) from gingival
	- From tibia: [[Adamantioma]] 
	- [[Pituitary ameloblastoma]] 
- May arise from [[Dentigerous cyst]]

### Clinical features
- [[Space Occupying Lesion]] 
	- Facial deformity
	- Inferior alveolar nerve invasion: parasthesia in teeth  
- Local Invasion: Surrounding bones leading to Fluctuation and Egg shell crackling
- [[Giant ameloblastoma arising from mandible.png]]

### Investigations
#### Radiology 
- Well defined margin, cystic lesion which may look like [[Dentigerous cyst]] 
	- Root resorption and tooth displacement
	- Bucco-lingual cortical expansion
- Mimics [[Giant cell tumor]] in appearance 
- Variants
	- Unilocular
	- Multilocular/honeycomb appearance
#### Biopsy
- Ameloblastic epithelium with connective tissue stroma
- Basal cell
- Follicular (commonest)
- Plexiform
- Acanthomatous
- Desmoplastic
- Granular
- BF PAD lao G

### Treatment
- [[Segmental resection]] is best
- Partial or total resection depending upon tumor size
- Composite = Bone + Soft tissue removal
- [[En bloc resection]] 
- [[Marginal resection]] for small tumors
- [[Mandibular reconstruction surgery]] after removal
