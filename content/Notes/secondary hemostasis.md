### Presentation
- Delayed presentation (min to hrs) after [[Trauma]] 
- Deep tissue bleeding
	- [[Hemarthrosis]]
	- [[Hematoma]]
	- Large palpable ecchymosis
### Intrinsic pathway
- Factor VIII deficiency ([[hemophilia A]])
- Factor IX deficiency ([[hemophilia B]])
- Factor XI deficiency ([[hemophilia C]])

### Extrinsic pathway:
- [[factor VII deficiency ]](autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutation of the F7 gene)

### Both pathways
- Impaired hepatic production of coagulation factors (e.g., [[Chronic liver disease]])
- Deficiency or inhibition of [[Vitamin K deficiency]]-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X 
	- [[Vitamin K deficiency]]: e.g., [[malabsorption syndrome]], depletion of gut flora (e.g., following antibiotic administration), vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn
	- Vitamin K antagonist therapy (e.g., [[warfarin]])
- Inhibition of coagulation factors by autoantibodies (most commonly anti-factor VIII)
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation ([[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]])
- Fibrinogen deficiency
- [[Anticoagulants]] treatment
