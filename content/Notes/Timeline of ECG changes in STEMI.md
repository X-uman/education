| Stage                                             | Characteristics                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acute(Myocardial damage ongoing)                  | - Hyperacute [[T wave]] (peaked T wave)                                   |
| (resembles hyperkalemia, impaired repolarization) | - [[ST elevation]] in two contiguous leads with reciprocal ST depressions |
| Intermediate(Myocardial necrosis present)         | - Absence of R wave                                                       |
|                                                   | - T-wave inversions                                                       |
|                                                   | - [[Pathological Q-wave]]                                                 |
| Chronic(Permanent scarring)                       | - Persistent, broad, and deep Q waves                                     |
|                                                   | - Often incomplete recovery of R waves                                    |
|                                                   | - Permanent T-wave inversion is possible                                  |
