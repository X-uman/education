### Introduction
- **Rapid onset (<= 6 months)** of enlarged, erythematous and edematous (Peau d'orange) breast due to dermal plugging of lymphatic vessels by tumor
- Involvement of dermal lymphatics alone without the classic clinical presentation is not considered inflammatory carcinoma
- Must be of rapid onset; duration of symptoms of ≤ 6 months
- Accounts for 2-5% of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases
- There is frequent peau d’orange and tumor emboli within lymphatic spaces on skin punch biopsy; however, these findings are not necessary to make the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer nor are they unique to inflammatory breast cancer as they can also be seen in locally advanced breast cancer. 
- A mass may or may not be seen on mammogram as in inflammatory breast cancer tumor quickly spreads to lymphatics (and beyond) and mammography has lower sensitivity in this setting.
### Presentation
- Higher incidence in black women
- Mean age is 56 years
- Patient **may have a history of being diagnosed with [[Mastitis]]** that does not respond to at least 1 week of antibiotics
- May or may not have a breast mass, typically not palpable due to rapid spread to lymphatics and distant sites but low volume of invasive carcinoma in breast
- Breast skin with erythema and edema **occupying at least 33% of the breast** is required to make the diagnosis
- 25% have metastasis during presentation

### Pathogenesis
- Tumor microemboli in the lymphatic spaces causes obstruction that leads to the clinical presentation of peau d’orange appearance
    - _RhoC_ overexpression induces angiogenesis and facilitates rapid metastasis 
- [[E-cadherin]] accumulation / overexpression within tumor emboli

### Gross description
- Skin findings and mass lesions are usually not present after neoadjuvant therapy

### Microscopic (histologic) description
- Presence of **tumor cells in dermal lymphovascular spaces**
- Tumor cells or lymphatic spaces may be scant and therefore assessment at multiple levels is recommended
- It is not a specific histological subtype
    - Most associated invasive carcinoma is high grade invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type; however, other types of breast cancers can present as inflammatory carcinoma 
- Ductal carcinoma in situ is often absent
- **Classified as T4d in AJCC cancer staging**
- T stage does not change following neoadjuvant therapy (ypT4d)

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Mastitis]]
- [[Breast abscess]]
- [[Paget's Disease of Nipple]]
