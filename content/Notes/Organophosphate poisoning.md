### Clinical features
![[Pasted image 20240502172523.png]]

### Stages
- Early: [[Parasympathetic system]] hyperactivity
- Intermediate: Acetylcholine induced down-regulation of nicotinic receptors in muscles, 
	- Onset: 1-4 days, lasts about 3 weeks
	- Proximal neck muscle weakness
	- [[Diaphragmatic paralysis]]
	- [[Respiratory failure]]
	- No parasympathetic signs
- [[Organophosphorus agent induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN)]] 
	- Features of [[Peripheral neuropathy]]
	- Recovery is incomplete
### Management
- Early [[Endotracheal intubation]] because patients may develop [[Diaphragmatic paralysis]] and CNS respiratory center depression
	- Avoid [[Succinylcholine]] while doing [[Rapid Sequence induction]]
- Adequate volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (eg, normal saline or Lactated Ringer solution) should be performed concomitantly with other resuscitative and diagnostic efforts.
- [[Atropine in OP poisoning]] 
- The current World Health Organization recommendation for IV bolus therapy with pralidoxime is at least 30 mg/kg in adults, and 25 to 50 mg/kg for children, based on severity of symptoms, administered slowly over 30 minutes. Pralidoxime should not be administered without concurrent atropine.
- Organophosphate-induced seizures should be treated with a benzodiazepine.
