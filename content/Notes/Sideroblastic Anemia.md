### Causes
- Congenital
	- ALA synthase mutation (X-linked recessive)
	- Mitochondrial glycine transporter mutation (Autosomal recessive)
- Clonal: [[Myelodysplastic syndrome]]
- Reversible
	- [[Vitamin B6(Pyridoxine)]] deficiency causes heme synthesis dysfunction with impaired transfer of iron to hemoglobin, which ultimately leads to iron accumulation in RBCs.
	- [[Isoniazid]], [[Linezolid]], [[Cycloserine]] 
	- [[Lead poisoning]]
	- [[Porphyrias]]
	- [[Alcoholism]]  
	- [[Copper deficiency]]
	- [[Zinc toxicity]] 

### Features
- Microcytic hypochromic RBCs
- Poikilocytosis, anisocytosis
- Increased [[Iron indices]] 
- [[Sideroblasts]] in Bone marrow whose iron can be stained with Prussian blue
- Erythoid hyperplasia in BM 
- Basophilic stippling in Peripheral blood smears due to ribosomes
- Pappenheimer bodies: Iron precipitates in the RBCs on doing Prussian staining

### Treatment
- Treat underlying cause
- Moderate to high dose Vitamin B6 supplementation
- BM transplantation
