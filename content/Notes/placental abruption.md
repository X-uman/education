### roots
- #DxOE  Abrupt onset of [[PV bleeding]] 
- [[Obstretical emergency]] 
### Stem
- [[Retroplacental hematoma]] 
	- [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] 
- Complete/Partial
- Acute/chronic
- Spontaneous/traumatic
- [[Subchorionic hematoma]] 

- [[Short umbilical cord]] 
- [[multiple gestation]] 
- Maternal Age <20, >35
- Prior history of abruption 

### Management
- [[Abruptio placenta management flowchart]] 

### Complications
- Very contractile uterus: Baseline Hypertonus and contraction intraamniotic pressure which may compromise [[Placental Hemodynamics]] and lead to [[fetal hypoxia]] 
- Couvelaire Uterus
- [[Sheehan syndrome]] 
- [[AKI.canvas|AKI]]
- [[Cesarean Section]] within 20min of [[Fetal distress]] 
- [[FFP]] 

- [[IUFD]] 
- Maternal DIC and hypovolemic shock: occurs as a result of blood loss and massive coagulation; the placenta is rich in tissue thromboplastin, which is released as a result of the placental abruption.
- Couvelaire uterus
	- Retroplacental hemorrhage may extend through the uterus into the peritoneum.
	- The myometrium is weakened, with possible subsequent uterine rupture during contractions.
