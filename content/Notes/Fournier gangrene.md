### Definition
- It is a form of polymicrobial (type 1) [[Necrotizing fasciitis]] 
### Risk factors

- Breach of integrity of urethral or GI mucosa

### Etiology
- 

### Presentation
- Fournier gangrene typically begins abruptly with severe pain and may spread rapidly to the anterior abdominal wall and the gluteal muscles.
- Men are more commonly affected than women

### Investigations
- [[Notes/Inflammatory markers|Inflammatory markers]] 
- MRI: Shows edema
- CECT: Decreased contrast uptake by necrotic area
- USG: Gas underneath skin

### Management
- [[Surgical debridement]] or Necrosectomy 
- Blunt dissection with fingers to open up micro abscesses 
- [[drains]] 
- Antiseptic [[wound care]] 
- [[Sitz bath]] 
- IV antibiotics
- Analgesics
- [[Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy]] 
- [[flap]] or [[Skin graft]] 

### Differential diagnosis
- [[cellulitis]]
- [[Balanitis]]
- [[Orchitis]]
- [[Epididymo-orchitis]]
- [[Hernia]] strangulation
- [[Hydrocele]] infection
