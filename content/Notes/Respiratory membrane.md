Variables of respiratory membrane: 
	- Thickness
		- [[Pneumonia]]
		- [[chemical pneumonitis]]
		- [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] 
		- [[Pulmonary edema]] 
		- [[Hyaline membrane disease]]
		- [[Interstitial lung disease]] 
		- Alveolar flooding
			- Blood: [[Pulmonary Hemorrhage]] 
			- Exudates: [[ARDS]] 
	- Area
		- [[Atelectasis]]
		- [[Pleural effusion]]
		- [[Pneumothorax]]
		- [[Congenital diaphragmatic hernias]] 

The diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide ([[DLCO]]) depends on the effective alveolar surface area available to participate in gas exchange. 
	- In neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, surfactant deficiency results in alveolar [[atelectasis]]. 
	- This decreases effective alveolar surface area and thus decreases rather than increases DLCO. 
	- Increased DLCO is expected in conditions such as [[polycythemia]] and obesity.
