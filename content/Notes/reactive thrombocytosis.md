### Management
- low-dose aspirin could be considered if this child had a high platelet count postoperatively. Reactive thrombocytosis alone is, however, not an indication for thromboprophylaxis with warfarin.
- [[Hydroxyurea]] can be used on an off-label basis to treat severe reactive thrombocytosis, which may occur following [[splenectomy]]. Hydroxyurea should not, however, be routinely given to all patients who undergo splenectomy.
