### Etiology
- [[ischemia]]
- [[Starvation]]
- [[Chronic pancreatitis]]
- [[Ketoacidosis]]
- [[sepsis]]
- Increases in Anaerobic respiration
- Increases in [[Hypoxemia]] i.e. [[Respiratory failure]] 
### Presentation
- Gastrointestinal symptoms: 
	- nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
	- abdominal pain, flatulence
- Severe symptoms: 
	- muscle cramps, 
	- hyperventilation, 
	- All degrees of [[Altered consciousness]] 

### Effects
- [[Tachypnea]]
- Precapillary Vasodilatation & post-capillary vasoconstriction which leads to [[stasis]] and formation of [[microvascular thrombosis]] 
- [[Acidosis]] leads to [[Altered consciousness]] 

### Monitoring 
- Venous lactate is an essential marker of resuscitation, best indicator of overall and GIT perfusion 
	- < 2 mmol/L – [[Early total care]]
	- 2–3 mmol/L – Look at the trend (increasing or decreasing)
	- > 3 mmol/L – May be under-resuscitated; should either have further resuscitation or [[damage control surgery]] (DCS) if surgery is urgent
	- > 5 mmol/L – DCS
- 5mmol/l is indicator of bad resuscitation
- < 2mmol/l is indicator of good resuscitation
