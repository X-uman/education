### Pathophysiology
- Inherited mutation in the PKHD1 gene → defective fibrocystin (also called polyductin) → cystic dilation of collecting ducts and bile ducts (intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts)

### Prognosis
- Neonates with severe cystic dilatation have a poor life expectancy (probability of death within the 1st year of life is ∼ 30%)
- The majority of children who survive infancy have a life expectancy greater than 10 years.
- The prognosis depends on the extent of renal and hepatic impairment:
	- Renal cysts and enlargement lead to systemic hypertension and progressive renal failure.
	- Progressive portal hypertension and hepatic fibrosis lead to liver failure.
