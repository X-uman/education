- Measure of fat solubility
- Ratio of Brain tissue concentration vs Blood concentrations when Diffusion into brain has completed 
- high brain-blood partition coefficient means a substance has a strong affinity for brain tissue and is more likely to accumulate there
- A low brain-blood partition coefficient is desirable for a faster induction and recovery from anesthesia 

- Affects duration of action
- [[Nitrous Oxide]] had least BBPC among anesthetics
- [[Halothane]] has highest value

- Distribution and uptake into brain also depends upon [[cerebral perfusion]]
