### Introduction
- Insulinomas are predominantly benign, pancreatic islet beta-cell tumors associated with increased insulin production. 
- While most insulinomas are sporadic, some are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasias (e.g., parathyroid tumors, pituitary adenomas, gastrinomas). 
- Insulinomas present clinically with recurrent attacks of hypoglycemic symptoms that subside after glucose intake. 
- The diagnosis is established by demonstrating inappropriately elevated serum insulin following a fasting test. 
- Insulinomas are differentiated from other causes of hyperinsulinemia (e.g., exogenous insulin administration) by the presence of elevated levels of proinsulin and C-peptide. 
- The treatment of choice is surgical enucleation of the insulinoma. In inoperable cases and patients with persistent hypoglycemic attacks, diazoxide can be used to decrease insulin secretion.

### Epidemiology
- Sex: ♀ > ♂
- Age range: ∼30–60 years
- Incidence: ∼ 4 cases/1,000,000 persons per year [1]

### Pathophysiology
- Insulinomas are neuroendocrine tumors that arise from beta cells of the pancreas, commonest endocrine tumor of pancreas
	- < 1% occur at ectopic sites (e.g., spleen).
	- ∼ 90% of insulinomas occur as solitary tumors 
		- Insulinomas may rarely occur as multiple adenomas. Multiple insulinomas are usually associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
- Most insulinomas occur sporadically
- Over 90% of insulinomas are benign 
- ∼ 5% of insulinomas are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). [3]

### Clinical features
- [[Whipple triad]] of [[Hypoglycemia]] 
- Weight gain (Due to anabolic effect of insulin)
- Symptoms characteristic of other endocrine neoplasias may occur 

### Diagnostics
- Whipple triad: characteristic of insulinoma
- [[Hyperinsulinemia]] 
- Fasting test: Positive if serum glucose levels remain low (< 40 mg/dL) and insulin levels remain high even after fasting for 72 hours. 
	- Because of the risk of severe hypoglycemia, the fasting test should always be performed in a hospital under clinical supervision
- ↑ C-peptide and ↑ proinsulin levels 
	- Elevated C-peptide levels are not seen with the use of exogenous insulin (e.g., factitious hypoglycemia)
- Imaging (endoscopic ultrasonography, CT, MRI, selective angiography): for surgical planning
- Elevated C-peptide and proinsulin levels may also be the result of sulfonylurea use! This can be ruled out by screening serum samples for sulfonylureas.
### Treatment
- Surgery
	- Treatment of choice if tumor is operable
	- Surgical enucleation of the pancreatic adenoma (by either open surgery or laparoscopy) 
		- Subtotal pancreatectomy may be indicated in addition to enucleation in patients with multiple insulinomas.
- Medication
	- Treatment of inoperable tumors or recurrent hypoglycemic attacks despite surgery
	- Inhibitors of insulin release
		- [[Diazoxide]]
		- [[Somatostatin]] analogues: Octeotride in refractory cases to Diazoxide
	- Other drugs: [[Calcium Channel blockers]] 
### Differential diagnosis
- [[Nesidioblastosis]]
- [[Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia]]
