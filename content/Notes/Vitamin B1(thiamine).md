### Pathophysiology
- Thiamine deficiency → impaired glucose breakdown → ATP depletion → tissue damage that primarily affects highly aerobic tissues (e.g., brain, heart)
- High-dose glucose infusions lead to increased ATP depletion, which can trigger Wernicke encephalopathy.
- In malnourished individuals and chronic alcohol users/heavy drinkers, thiamine should be administered before glucose infusions.

### Clinical manifestations

|                                 | Motor/Sensory             | Cognitive | Ataxia/Ophthalmoplegia |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| [[Beriberi]] (dry)              | [[Peripheral neuropathy]] | Yes       | No                     |
| [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]] | No PN                     | Yes       | Yes                    |
- [[Leigh syndrome]] 
### Diagnostics
- ↓ Serum thiamine levels
- ↓ Erythrocyte transketolase activity (increases after thiamine pyrophosphate administration)
- ↑ Serum lactate and pyruvate
