## roots
- #DxOE  Abrupt onset of [[PV bleeding]] 
- [[Obstretical emergency]]
## Stem
- [[Retroplacental hematoma]]
	- [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] 
- Complete/Partial
- Acute/chronic
- Spontaneous/traumatic
[[Subchorionic hematoma]] 

[[Short umbilical cord]]
[[multiple gestation]] 
Maternal Age <20, >35
Prior history of abruption 

## branches
- Very contractile uterus: Baseline Hypertonus and contraction intraamniotic pressure which may compromise [[Placental Hemodynamics]] and lead to [[fetal hypoxia]] 
- Couvelaire Uterus
- [[Sheehan syndrome]] 
- [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]]
- [[AKI.canvas|AKI]]

- [[Cesarean Section]] within 20min of [[Fetal distress]] 
- [[FFP]] 
## Mimics
- [[Normal Labor]]

## Analogy
- [[Extradural hemorrhage]]: How a bleeding point shears off the attachment as it expands along the plane
- [[hemorrhage]]
- How to differentiate from [[Uterine Rupture]]?
	- [[Uterine Contractions]] + 
	- Uterus is tender, rigid
- [[Aortic dissection]]
