- Onset: focal or generalized onset
- To-and-fro movements (Clonic movements)
- Bilaterally symmetrical (Tonic movements) and all four limbs involved?
- Unrolling of eyes 
- head deviation
- Child passed urine or stool?
- post-ictal: quickly recovers (some nausea and vomiting?)
	- Speech disturbances, difficulty walking or visual disturbances
