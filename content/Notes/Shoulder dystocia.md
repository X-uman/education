### What is it?
- Inability to deliver shoulder within 1min of delivery of head
- It is an obstetric emergency

### What is happening
- Bi-acromian diameter: 12cm, 
- in lithotomy, AP diameter is 13cm, when BAD is more than AP diameter
- **Turtle neck sign**: Head recedes into the pelvis when tried to pull out.
- The diagnosis is made when the routine practice of gentle, downward traction on the fetal head fails to accomplish delivery of the anterior shoulder.
### Causes 
- [[Macrosomia]]
- [[Postmaturity]] 
- [[Prolonged labor]] 
- [[Multiparity]] 
- [[Anencephaly]] 
- [[Fetal Ascites]] 
- Male sex 
- Excessive gestational weight gain and obesity
- Intrapartum
	- [[Assisted delivery]] 
- Recurrent shoulder dystocia is more likely when
	- Birth weight is greater than in the previously affected pregnancy
	- Prepregnancy weight is greater than in the previously affected pregnancy
	- Gestational weight gain is greater than in the previously affected pregnancy
	- Second stage of labor is longer than in the previously affected pregnancy
	- Birth weight is >4000 g

### Management
- Obstretic #Emergency  
- Liberal [[Episiotomy]]
1. [[McRobert's maneuver]] 
2. McRoberts Maneuver + Suprapubic pressure
3. [[Posterior arm delivery]] 
4. [[Axillary traction for delivery of the posterior shoulder]] 
5. Rotational maneuver 
	- [[Rubin maneuver]] 
	- [[Woods screw maneuver]] 
- The [[Gaskin all-fours maneuver]] may be a good initial choice for the mother in a birthing bed with no or only local or pudendal anesthesia.
#### Other methods
- Gaskin: All 4 limb's position/Dog position
- [[Gunn-Zavanelli-O'Leary maneuver]]: Push head back to pelvis and deliver by [[Cesarean Section]]
- cleidotomy
- Symphysiotomy: avoided
- Posterior axilla sling traction (PAST)
