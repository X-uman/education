### Risk factors
- Indirect evidence for a role of _Malassezia_ in seborrheic dermatitis derives from the observation that most of the effective therapeutic agents have antifungal activity.
- The inflammation of seborrheic dermatitis may be mediated by the innate immune system response to irritants produced by _Malassezia_, including free fatty acids, lipase, and reactive oxygen species
- 
### Associated with
- [[Parkinsonism]]
- Stroke
- Malabsorption syndrome
- [[Mucocutaneous manifestations of AIDS]]: 
	- May involve unusual sites, more severe and diffuse
	- seen with CD4 counts <400 cells/microL and is more diffuse and severe in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/microL
	- May regress with antiretroviral therapy, but can also be a manifestation of [[immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome]] 

### Presentation
- [[Seborrheic areas]] 
- Present as greasy, scales with erythematous skin
