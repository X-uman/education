### Etiology 
- [[Rotator cuff injuries]]
- [[Scapular dyskinesis]]
- [[shoulder instability (TUBS and AMBRI)]] 
- [[Bicipital tendonitis]] 
- [[SLAP lesions]]
- [[GIRD]] 

Here's the information organized into a table:

| Impingement Type      | Pathophysiology                                                                                                                  | Associated Factors/Abnormalities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Impingement   | Structural abnormalities within the subacromial space lead to mechanical compression of the rotator cuff tendons and bursa.      | - Acromial shape variations (e.g., hooked acromion, type III acromion)<br>- Acromial spurs or osteophytes<br>- Thickening or inflammation of the coracoacromial ligament<br>- Subacromial bursal thickening or fibrosis<br>- Rotator cuff tendon degeneration or hypertrophy           |
| Secondary Impingement | Altered scapular or humeral mechanics result in abnormal positioning of the humeral head relative to the acromion during motion. | - Scapular dyskinesis or malpositioning (e.g., downward rotation)<br>- Weakness or imbalance of scapular stabilizers (e.g., serratus anterior, lower trapezius)<br>- Glenohumeral instability or laxity<br>- Muscle tightness or stiffness (e.g., pectoralis minor, posterior capsule) |
| Internal Impingement  | Pinching of the rotator cuff tendons and posterior-superior labrum between the humeral head and the glenoid rim during motion.   | - Repetitive overhead throwing or serving motions<br>- Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD)<br>- Posterior capsular contracture<br>- Superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears                                                                                          |

### Presentation
- Impingement attitude: Abduction, slight flexion and internal rotation 

## Types

	- [[acromioclavicular joint]] Arthropathy
	- 
- Secondary impingement

### Tests
- Painful arc
- Dropping arm
- Passive test

- Empty can test



### Management
- Sub-GIRD acromian decompression

### Differential diagnoses
| Differential Diagnosis      | How it Differs from Subacromial Impingement                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Rotator cuff tear]]       | Frequently causes weakness in addition to pain, associated with positive drop arm test and weakness with resisted external rotation                                                          |
| [[Adhesive capsulitis]]     | Manifests as restricted active and passive glenohumeral motion, often associated with recent shoulder injury or surgery, and may be diabetic                                                 |
| Biceps tendinopathy         | Typically involves isolated anterior shoulder pain in the region of the bicipital groove, with focal tenderness of the tendon and positive Speeds test                                       |
| [[Subcoracoid impingement]] | Occurs when anterior structures are compressed between the coracoid process and the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, reproduces pain with forward flexion, adduction, and internal rotation |
| Shoulder labrum injury      | Manifests as chronic pain with overhead activity, often with weakness, instability, and sport-specific dysfunction, may include "clicking" or mechanical symptoms                            |
