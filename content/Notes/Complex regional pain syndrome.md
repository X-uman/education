### Pathophysiology
| Mechanism                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Neurogenic inflammation**                                | Inflammatory molecules (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, TNF-alpha) and neuropeptides (e.g., substance P) released from peripheral nerves cause persistent pain and perception of nonpainful stimuli as painful.                                                                    |
|  **Nociceptive sensitisation**                             | Extreme sensitivity or allodynia due to nociceptive sensitization.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  **Vasomotor dysfunction**                                 | Blood flow problems leading to swelling and discoloration of the affected limb.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  **Maladaptive neuroplasticity**                           | Changes in the brain's structure and function due to constant pain signals.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  **Aberrant response to tissue injury**                    | CRPS results from an inappropriate response to tissue injury, involving cognitive, motor, and nociceptive processing.                                                                                                                                                |
|  **Increased activation of cortical areas**                | Pinprick stimulation of a CRPS-affected limb results in increased activation of S1 cortex, S2 areas, insula, associative-somatosensory cortices, frontal cortices, and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex.                                                       |
|  **Reduced sympathetic nervous system outflow**            | Contrary to previous beliefs, there is reduced sympathetic nervous system outflow, at least in the affected region.                                                                                                                                                  |
|  **Wind-up &bCentral nervous system sensitization (CNS)**  | Increased sensation of pain with time. Key neurologic processes involved in the induction and maintenance of CRPS.                                                                                                                                                   |
|  **Involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors**         | The NMDA receptor plays a significant role in CNS sensitization. Elevated CNS glutamate levels promote wind-up and CNS sensitization.                                                                                                                                |
|  **Immunological functions**                               | Various immune processes contribute to peripheral and central sensitization.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  **Trauma-related cytokine release**                       | Exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation, cortical reorganization, and oxidative damage are all factors implicated in the pathophysiology of CRPS.                                        |
|  **Reduced bone mineral density**                          | Mechanisms leading to reduced bone mineral density include dysbalance of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity, mild secondary hyperparathyroidism, and the presence of autoantibodies stimulating nociceptors and causing inflammation. |
|  **Secondary hyperparathyroidism**                         | Trigger not yet identified, possibly related to dysregulated autonomic nervous system activity or other factors.                                                                                                                                                     |

### Diagnostics
Here's a tabulated summary of the diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS):

| Criteria                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continuing pain**              | Pain that persists beyond the expected period of healing and is disproportionate to any inciting event.                                                                      |

| *[[Sudomotor function]]/Edema*   | Reports of edema, sweating changes, or sweating asymmetry.                                                                                                                   |
| **Signs categories:**            | At least 2/4 of following                                                                                                                                                    |
| *Sensory*                        | Evidence of hyperalgesia (increased pain response to pinprick) or allodynia (pain response to light touch, temperature sensation, deep somatic pressure, or joint movement). |
| *Motor/Trophic*                  | Evidence of decreased range of motion, motor dysfunction, or trophic changes.                                                                                                |
| *Vasomotor*                      | Evidence of temperature asymmetry (>1 Â°C), skin color changes, or asymmetry.                                                                                                 |

| **Exclusion of other diagnoses** | There is no other diagnosis that better explains the signs and symptoms observed.                                                                                            |

These criteria are essential for making a clinical diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome.

| Type         | Clinical findings      | Old names/Synonyms                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Type I (90%) | No neuropathology      | reflex sympathetic dystrophy, RSD, Sudeck's atrophy |
| Type II      | neuropathology present | causalgia                                           |
[[Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome]] is considered to be subtype of CPRS I
