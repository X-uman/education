|**Mechanism**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Chronic Hypoxia and Low Cardiac Output**|Reduced oxygenation and blood flow lead to changes in skin perfusion and color, especially in the cheeks.|
|**Vasodilation of Facial Blood Vessels**|Compensatory dilation of facial capillaries causes a reddish-purple discoloration.|
|**Pulmonary Hypertension**|Increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation exacerbates hypoxia and systemic vasodilation.|
|**Cyanosis**|Poor oxygenation and reduced blood flow contribute to a bluish tinge, enhancing the malar flush appearance.|
### Clinical Context
Mitral facies is typically seen in patients with advanced mitral stenosis, often alongside other symptoms such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat), and fatigue. It serves as a physical sign that may prompt further cardiovascular evaluation, including echocardiography, to assess the severity of mitral stenosis and guide appropriate management.
