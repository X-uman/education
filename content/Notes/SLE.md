### Pathogenesis
###### Risk_Factors
- Genetics: HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3, Classical [[complement pathway]] proteins deficiency
- Hormones: [[Estrogen exposure]] 
- Environment
	- Smoking
	- Silica exposure
	- UV-rays and EBV trigger flares
	- Drugs
###### Pathophysiology
- Due to complement deficiency: [[Immune complexes]] and Cellular debris cannot be cleared by macrophages leading to Lymphocytes targeting normally hidden intracellular antigens by auto-antibodies production i.e. [[Sequestered antigens]] 
- Type III [[Hypersensitivity reaction]] inside microvasculature of kidney, skin, joints, vessels
- Type II Hypersensitivity reaction against antigens of cells e.g. RBCs leading to Cytopenia

### Presentation
- #demography Women of child bearing age
- [[Connective tissue]] are involved 
- Systemic and local signs of [[inflammation]]
- Typical findings of [[Vasculitis]] in different systems
	- Malar rash: differentiate from [[Seborrheic dermatitis]], [[Acne rosacea]] 
	- Joint pain: without deformities, but #resembling  [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
	- Renal involvement: [[Lupus nephritis]]
- Other findings
	- [[Cutaneous lupus]] : CLE
	- [[Neuropsychiatric lupus]]: NSLE
	- [[Drug induced lupus]]
	- [[Neonatal lupus]]
	- [[Raynaud phenomenon]]
	- Painless [[Oral cavity ulcers]]
	- Non-scarring [[Alopecia]] except if #associated with Discoid rashes
	- [[Serositis]]
	- Libman-Sacks [[Endocarditis]]
	- [[Photosensitivity]]

### Investigations
- Highest sensitivity: Antinuclear Antibodies ANA
- Highest Specificity: 
	- Anti-Smith Antibodies: Most specific
	- Anti-DsDNA: disease severity correlates with its level 
- Drug induced lupus: Anti-histone Antibodies
- Fetal AV block: Anti-Rho positive 
- #screening: [[Antiphospholipid Syndrome]] 
- Other:
	- Complement levels: ↓ C3 and/or ↓ C4 in patients with active disease 
	- [[Inflammatory markers]]
	- [[complement pathway]] levels
	- [[Urine Analysis]] 
	- Joint Radiology: **non erosive arthritis**
	- Echocardiography for Serositis and Endocarditis
	- Skin biopsy with atypical presentation or no response to initial therapy
	- Lupus Band test on Ig and Complement deposition in Skin layers
	- RFT and Kidney Biopsy for [[Lupus nephritis]] 

### Diagnosis
- [[ACR-EULAR classification criteria for SLE]] #link 
- ASCVD risk assessment recommended in all patients with SLE (ASCVD risk-enhancing factor).
- Disease severity can be classified based on the presence of clinical features and laboratory markers of disease activity and/or organ damage in SLE.

| Disease Severity                    | Clinical Findings                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mild (no vital organs affected)     | Constitutional symptoms<br>Mild arthritis<br>Rash<br>Cytopenias                       |
| Moderate (no vital organs affected) | Cutaneous vasculitis<br>Serositis<br>RA-like arthritis<br>Moderate rash<br>Cytopenias |
| Severe or Organ-threatening         | Nephritis<br>Myelitis<br>Pneumonitis<br>Mesenteric vasculitis<br>Severe cytopenias    |

- Prevention and monitoring for medication-induced adverse effects 
	- All patients: Offer influenza and pneumococcus immunizations.
	- Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants
		- Assess for infection.
		- Monitor for side effects of glucocorticoid therapy.
	- Hydroxychloroquine: ophthalmologic screening


### Complications
- Infections: common cause in treated patients
- MI: commonest in SLE overall 
- CKD
- Stroke
- Pancytopenia
