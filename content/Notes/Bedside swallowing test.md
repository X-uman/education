- A clinical assessment for swallowing abnormalities that involves the examination of the anatomy, function, and reflexes of the mouth, tongue, and mandible along with a trial of food and liquid
- The test is considered positive if the patient is unable to drink continuously, coughs up after the swallowing attempt, and/or has a wet, gargling, or hoarse vocal quality.
- Informs decisions on dietary modification (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids, nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) and further investigations
- If the test is positive, a formal swallowing study, such as a videofluoroscopic swallowing examination, should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
- Should be performed in all patients with ALS to screen for dysphagia.
- Also performed in other neurological conditions that manifest with dysphagia, such as Parkinson disease, acute stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
- If swallowing difficulties present, other tests for swallowing like Videofluoroscopic swallowing examination is required to confirm the diagnosis
- atients with ALS who have swallowing difficulties may need specialized nutritional support (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids, nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). Bedside swallowing test is also performed for other neurological conditions that manifest with dysphagia, such as Parkinson disease, acute [[stroke]], and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
