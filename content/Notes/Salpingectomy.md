### Indications
- Ruptured tube or moderately or severely damage tube.
- Uncontrolled tubal bleeding.
- A large tubal pregnancy. In our practice, we use 3 cm as the threshold.
### Considerations
- Ectopic pregnancy
	- For patients who have completed childbearing, bilateral salpingectomy may be performed as permanent sterilization.
- decrease in the risk of tubal neoplasia with spread to the ovary
- appears to be associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer
