### Indications
- Compartment pressure > 30 mm Hg 
- Perfusion pressure < 35 mmHg
- Duration within 4 - 6 h i.e. possibility of limb salvage is there
- Limb paralysis

### Prognosis
- ≤ 4–6 h: almost complete recovery
- 6–12 h: first necrosis
- ≥ 12 h: necrosis; little or no return of function

### Protocol
- Mark the incision sites over the affected compartments, ensuring to include proximal and distal incisions for complete decompression.
- Perform a longitudinal skin incision through the fascia, extending from the marked proximal to distal points.
- Open the fascia carefully using blunt dissection or scissors, avoiding injury to neurovascular structures.
- Release the fascia along the entire length of the incision to achieve adequate decompression of the affected compartments.
- Monitor compartment pressures intraoperatively if available and adjust decompression as needed.
- Irrigate the surgical site with saline or an antimicrobial solution to minimize the risk of infection.
- Close the skin incisions primarily if feasible; otherwise, leave them open for delayed primary closure or secondary intention healing.
- Apply sterile dressings over the incisions and immobilize the limb with appropriate splints or casts as indicated.
- Document the procedure details, including findings, interventions, and postoperative instructions.
### for upper limb
• Exploration must extend deeply to the FDPand FPL. 
• Necrotic muscle tissue is excised. 
• Median nerve freed beneath the lacertus fibrosus. 
• Ulnar nerve is freed and transplanted anteriorly . 
• Brachial artery must be inspected and decompressed . 
• Surgical wound is left open for secondary closure later when swelling subsibes. 
• Extremity supported with splint in funtional position. 

### Rebound compartment syndrome
- Onset: occurs 6–12 hours after surgical reperfusion
- Etiology: increased capillary permeability and edema, often due to insufficient fasciotomy incisions
