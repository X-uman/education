- Elevations in ALP are due to increased bone turnover. 
- Calcium, Phosphates, PTH 
### Pathogenesis
- Inadequate [[Bone mineralization]]  
- Bone does not get enough Compressive strength 
- Bone becomes too much pliable: deformities
- Delayed [[Bone age]] 
- Low calcium combined with low phosphate levels lead to defective osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis evidenced by weakened bone and malformed and enlarged growth plates. 

### Presentation
- Impaired [[Bone mineralization]] 
- [[Hypocalcemia]] 
- [[Proximal myopathy]], [[cardiomyopathy]] 
- [[Hypotonia]]  
- [[Short stature]]  
- Thickened Growth plates
	- [[Rachitic & Scorbutic rosary| Rachitic rosary]], Pectus carinatum (Barrel chest equivalent of COPD?)
	- Prominent frontal bone
	- Double malleoli due to metaphyseal hyperplasia
- Protruding abdomen, [[Harrison's groove]] 
- Respiratory infections

### Diagnosis

### Management
- Treat underlying cause and [[Bone health optimization]] 
- Fully complete treatment for underlying osteomalacia before treating other metabolic bone diseases (e.g., osteoporosis)
    - Target serum 25(OH)D: > 30 ng/mL
- Target PTH level: normal 
- [[Vitamin D supplementation]] 

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Osteoglophonic dysplasia with dwarfism]]
- [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]]
- [[Neurofibromatosis]]
- [[McCune-Albright syndrome]]
- Child abuse/neglect
- [[Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia]]
