### Definition
**Recurrent (Recidivent) Ascites** refers to the reaccumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity after it has been previously removed or managed. This condition is commonly seen in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. Here are the key points about recurrent ascites:
- More than 4 relapses in a year

1. **Reaccumulation of Fluid:**
   - Ascites that reaccumulates after therapeutic paracentesis or medical management within a relatively short period, typically within four weeks.

2. **Associated with Chronic Liver Disease:**
   - Recurrent ascites often indicates progressive liver disease and impaired liver function, such as cirrhosis.
   - Portal hypertension, resulting from increased pressure in the portal vein, is a primary contributor to the development and recurrence of ascites.

3. **Symptoms and Signs:**
   - Abdominal distension
   - Discomfort or pain
   - Shortness of breath (due to pressure on the diaphragm)
   - Early satiety (feeling full quickly)
   - Weight gain

4. **Management Challenges:**
   - Recurrent ascites can be difficult to manage due to its persistence despite standard treatments.
   - Frequent paracentesis may be required to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.
   - Diuretic therapy may be employed, but effectiveness can vary, and complications such as renal dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances can limit use.

5. **Underlying Causes:**
   - The most common underlying cause is cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
   - Other causes can include malignancies, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and infections like tuberculosis.

6. **Advanced Treatment Options:**
   - When recurrent ascites is not manageable with standard medical therapy, advanced treatments may be considered:
     - **Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS):** A procedure to reduce portal hypertension and alleviate ascites.
     - **Liver Transplantation:** Considered in eligible patients with advanced liver disease.
     - **Palliative Measures:** To manage symptoms and improve the patient's comfort and quality of life.

Recurrent ascites is a significant clinical challenge and often indicates a poor prognosis, highlighting the need for close monitoring and comprehensive management to address the underlying liver disease and associated complications.
