- Most common in children 
- Translocation t(8;14) in 75% of cases: reciprocal translocation involving the c-myc gene ([[Chromosome 8]]) and heavy-chain Ig locus ([[Chromosome 14]]) → overactivation of c-myc proto-oncogene → activation of transcription
- **Forms**
	- Sporadic: typically located in the abdomen or pelvis
