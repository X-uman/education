- Type C comprises 85% of Esophageal atresia
### Presentation
- [[Polyhydramnios]] (except Type E)
- Excessive secretions/foaming at mouth (except Type E)
- [[Aspiration Pneumonitis]] (except Type A)
- Gastric distention: if airway and esophagus are connected to stomach side (i.e. except Type A, B)

### Diagnostics 
 - Placement of a feeding tube: the feeding tube cannot pass through the esophagus in the case of esophageal atresia beyond 10-15 cm 
- X-ray of the thorax/abdomen
	- Esophageal pouch at the level of 3rd thoracic vertebra (except with an H‑type fistula) 
	- Large gastric bubble: air in the stomach (gross types A and B present with a gasless abdomen)
- Further diagnostics concerning [[VACTERL anomalies]]
    - Ultrasound of the abdomen
    - Echocardiography

### Management

##### Preoperative
- Placement of an oro-esophageal or naso-esophageal tube for continuous suction of secretions to prevent aspiration and facilitate breathing 
- Upper body elevated, left lateral decubitus position
- Antibiotics in case of aspiration pneumonia 
- Infants who potentially have esophageal atresia should not be fed orally under any circumstances!
- During initial management of an infant with esophageal atresia and distal tracheoesophageal fistula, every effort should be made to avoid distending the gastrointestinal tract, especially when using mechanical ventilation. The patient should be evaluated for components of the VACTERRL (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, radial limb) anomalies. Timing and extent of surgery are dictated by the stability of the patient.
##### Surgery
- Surgical treatment should be performed within the first 24 hours of birth.
- The goal is to reconnect the upper esophageal pouch and the lower esophagus. 
- A long gap between both ends of the esophagus may not allow primary repair. 
   - In this case, a gastrostomy tube is necessary to allow enteral feeding.
   - Treatment options include promoting elongation of the esophagus (via the[[Foker process]]) and colon interposition

##### Postoperative
- Uncomplicated surgery: transition to a normal diet after 2–3 days 
- Anastomosis under tension: postoperative ventilation (for approx. 5 days) 
- Radiological examination with a contrast agent (esophagram) one week after surgery to identify complications: e.g., [[esophageal stricture]] or [[Anastomotic leak]] 
- Approx. 4 weeks after the procedure: Gastroscopy (EGD) and dilation of the anastomosis may be necessary.

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Double aortic arch]]
- Status post C-section
- [[Choanal atresia]]
- [[Esophageal stenosis]]
- [[Achalasia]]
- Defective swallowing reflex 

### Prognosis
Surgical complications include
- [[Dysphagia]]
- [[GERD]] 
- Anastomotic stenosis
- Wheezing
- Infections of the respiratory tract
- Anastomotic insufficiency
- Recurrence of esophageal tracheal fistula
- Esophageal stricture
