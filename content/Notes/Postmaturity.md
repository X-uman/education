#### Definition:
- Late-term pregnancy: a pregnancy between 41 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks' gestation
- Post-term pregnancy: a pregnancy ≥ 42 0/7 weeks' gestation
- Post-term birth: live birth after the completion of 42 weeks of pregnancy (≥ 42 0/7 weeks' gestation)

#### Causes:
- The exact cause of postmaturity is not well understood. However, it may occur due to inaccurate estimation of gestational age, prolonged pregnancy, or genetic factors.
- Some causes

| Cause      | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wrong date |                                                                                                            |
| Hereditary |                                                                                                            |
| Maternal   | Primiparity, previous prolonged pregnancy, sedentary lifestyle, [[Elderly primigravida]], maternal obesity |
| Fetal      | [[Anencephaly]], Abnormal [[HPA axis]], Male fetus, oligohydramnios, anencephaly                           |
| Placental  | Steroid Sulphatase deficiency: Low estrogen                                                                |


#### Clinical Features:
- Macrosomia (large baby)
- Dry, cracked, or peeling skin
- Decreased vernix and lanugo
- Overgrown nails
- [[Meconium stained liquor]] 
- Placental aging leading to decreased function
- Increased risk of complications such as fetal distress, meconium aspiration syndrome, and stillbirth

#### Diagnosis:
- Diagnosis of postmaturity is based on the gestational age exceeding 42 weeks confirmed by ultrasound or reliable menstrual history.
- [[Amniocentesis]]
- [[Biophysical profile]]
- Fetal well being by twice weekly NST 
- X-ray: 
	- increased thickness and density of skull bone shadow

#### Management:
| Condition                          | Management                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Late-term pregnancy                | - Confirm accurate gestational age and estimated delivery date. <br> - Prefer first-trimester [[Antenatal USG]] for dating to prevent inaccuracies                                     |
| Suboptimally dated gestational age | - **Definition**: Gestational age not confirmed or adjusted using ultrasound before 22 0/7 weeks. <br> - Perform induction of labor at 41 weeks' gestation.                            |
| Well-dated gestational age         | - Offer shared decision-making<br>- [[membrane sweeping]] if not done previously. <br> - Offer for induction of labor or expectant management with [[Antepartum fetal surveillance]] . |
| Postterm pregnancy                 | - Perform induction of labor by 42 0/6 weeks' gestation. <br> - If induction is unsuccessful, perform a C-section.                                                                     |
|                                    | After 42 weeks' gestation, induction is recommended regardless of cervical favorability in order to avoid complications of post-term pregnancy.                                        |
