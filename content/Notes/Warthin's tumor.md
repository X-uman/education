### Introduction
- Aka **Papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum** 
- Aka Adenolymphoma 
- A type of [[Hamartoma]]: Arises from pre-parotid lymphatics
- Exclusive to [[Parotid Gland]]

- USG: diagnostic method of choice in salivary gland tumors
- MRI
- [[Techenetium-99 scan]]: Hotspot
- [[CT-scan]]: Cystic mass, presence of mural nodule is strongly suggestive of Warthin tumor.

	- Cystic areas
	- Papillary projections
	- Lymphatic aggregrations
	- Rare Histological subtypes:
	    - Oncocytoma (∼ 2% of cases)
	    - Basal cell adenoma (∼ 1–2% of cases)
	    - Myoepithelioma (∼ 1% of cases)
