### Functions
- [[Anti-oxidants]]
- Anti-neoplastic effects
- Reduces [[retinopathy of prematurity]] incidence
- Reduces [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] incidence
- Other functions
	- Inhibition of platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, and monocyte adhesion
	- Enzyme inhibition (e.g., protein kinase C, phospholipase A2)
	- Inhibition of gene transcription (e.g., for Î±-TTP, tropomyosin alpha-1 chain)
### Deficiency
- Neurological: Leads to [[Ataxia]] resembling [[Friedreich ataxia]] 
	- [[Demyelination]] of [[Dorsal column]]
	- Demyelination of [[Spinocerebellar tract]] 
- [[Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia]] due to [[hemolysis]]
- [[Intraventricular hemorrhage]] in preterm babies
- [[Acantholysis]] 
- [[Proximal myopathy]] 
### Toxicity
- Infants: Increased risk of [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] 
- High dose supplementation: Increases effects of [[Warfarin]] 
- Increased incidence of heart failure, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and increased mortality
### Therapeutic considerations
- Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: consider vitamin E for antioxidant effect
