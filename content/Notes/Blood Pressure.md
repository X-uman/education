### Principles
- B.P. = [[cardiac output]] x [[Peripheral Vascular resistance]] 
	- (see [[Ohm's law]])
- B.P. = [[Stroke volume]] x [[Pulse rate|Heart Rate]] x P.V.R
- B.P. = [[End Diastolic Volume]] x [[Ejection Fraction]] x Heart Rate x P.V.R.
##### Determinants
- Cardiac compliance
- Cardiac contractility: *see [[Myocardial depression]]* 
	- [[Coronary Artery]] 
	- [[Cardiac conduction system]] 
	- [[cardiomyopathy]] 
	- [[Inflammation]]: [[myocarditis]] 
	- [[Hypokalemia]] 
- [[Pulmonary Circulation]] 

Vascular resistance:
	- Ruptured [[Aortic Aneurysm]]
	- [[Anaphylaxis]]
	- [[Pericardial Tamponade]] 

- B.P. Systole contributed mostly by [[cardiac output]]
- Diastole contributed mostly by P.V.R.

### Prerequisites for measuring BP
- Cuff size: 3, 5, 7, 12.5 cm 
	- Air bag should encircle 75% of arm circumference
	- Width should cover two-thirds of length of upper arm
- Relax for 5 min
- Remove all overlying clothes
- Comfortably seated with legs uncrossed
- Middle of cuff at the level of RA i.e. Mid-point of sternum
- BP measured at both arms
- Repeat 2 min afterwards

### Methods of measuring BP
- Palpatory method
- [[Auscultatory method]]
- Flush method more useful in infants and children
- Doppler method

### Normal values
#### Pediatric age group
- Neonates: MAP corresponds to Gestational age
- 1 m - 1y: 80/50
- 1y-5y: 85/55
- 5-10y: 95-60 
###### Formula
- SBP = 90/55 + Age in years x 2
- 5th centile for Systolic BP = 70 + Age in years x 2

#### Adult age group
- BP = 120/80 mmHg
- [[Hypertension]]
