### Etiology
Numerous organisms have been cultured from mesenteric lymph nodes and blood, such as beta-hemolytic streptococcus, _Staphylococcus_ species, _Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridans, [[Yersinia]]_ species (responsible for most cases currently), _[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]], Giardia lamblia,_ and nonâ€“_Salmonella_ typhoid. Viruses, such as [[coxsackieviruses]] (A and B), rubeola virus, and adenovirus serotypes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, have also been implicated.

Mesenteric node involvement can also be part of infectious Epstein-Barr virus ([[EBV]]), acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and catscratch disease (CSD).
