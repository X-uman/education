### Etiology
- [[Genetics of ALS]]
- Environment 
	- Î²-N-methylamino-L-alanine 
	- [[Pesticides]]
	- [[Lead poisoning]] 
- [[Head injuries]]
- Smoking

### Pathophysiology
- Classically affects the entire motor neuron system at two or more levels (both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration).
   - [[UMN Lesions]] in the precentral gyrus and, frequently, prefrontal cortex
   - [[LMN Lesions]] in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem
- Potential underlying mechanisms include abnormal RNA processing and protein aggregation, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defective neurofilaments.

### Pathology
##### Macroscopic features 
- [[Atrophy]] of the [[precentral gyrus]]
- Thinning of ventral spinal roots
- Sclerosis and pallor of the [[corticospinal tract]]
- Muscle atrophy

##### Microscopic features
- Death of upper and lower motor neurons
- Inclusion bodies in affected neurons, e.g.:
   - [[Lipofuscin]] 
   - [[Bunina bodies]]  
	- Ubiquitin-positive aggregates (associated with the protein TDP-43, which is also found in [[frontotemporal dementia]])
- Neuroinflammation (e.g., proliferation of astroglia and microglia)
- Denervation, reinnervation, and atrophy of muscle fibers

### Presentation
- Both LMN and UMN signs
- Asymmetric limb Weakness
- [[Bulbar palsy]] 
- [[Pseudobulbar palsy]] 
- [[Thenar muscles]] Atrophy: [[Split hand sign]] 
- Cognitive impairment resembling [[Frontotemporal dementia]] 
- [[Autonomic dysfunction]] 
- Sensory Systems and tract are intact

### Diagnostics 
- Primarily a clinical diagnosis as Diagnosis of Exclusion
- [[Electromyography]]: fibrillations and positive sharp wave potentials in >= 3 regions in conjunction with clinical findings
- [[Nerve conduction studies]]: NORMAL
- Increased CK
- MRI to rule out other causes e.g. [[Cervical spondylosis]]
- [[Bedside swallowing test]] for [[Dysphagia]]
- [[Pulmonary function tests]]: [[Restrictive lung disease]] 

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Spinal muscular atrophy]] 
- [[Multifocal motor neuropathy]]
- [[Myasthenia gravis]]
- [[Lambert Eaton Syndrome]]
- [[Cervical spondylosis]]
- [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
- [[Poliomyelitis]]
### Management
- [[Riluzole]] 
- [[Edaravone]] 
- Sodium phenylbutyrate-tarurosdiol
