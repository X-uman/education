### Classification 
Here's the information organized into a tabulated format for each class of shock:

| Class of Shock | Blood Loss Volume | Symptoms                     | Urine Output        | Systolic BP Start Decreasing | Respiratory Rate             | Base Deficit |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| I              | 0-15%             | Slight anxiety, PR < 100     | Normal to decreased | No                           | Normal to slightly increased | 0-2          |
| II             | **15-30%**        | Anxiety, **100-120 /min**    | **Decreased**       | No                           | **Increased**                | 2-6          |
| III            | 30-40%            | Mild confusion, 120-140 /min | Markedly decreased  | **Begins to decrease**       | Markedly increased           | 6-10         |
| IV             | >40%              | Lethargy, >140 /min          | Markedly decreased  | Significantly decreased      | Markedly increased           | >10          |

- class II shock is often referred to as decompensated shock because the body's compensatory mechanisms start to fail, leading to worsening symptoms and vital signs. 
- As for the decrease in pulse pressure from class II shock, it's due to the body's compensatory mechanism of vasoconstriction, which increases peripheral resistance and reduces the stroke volume, thus reducing the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. This decrease helps to maintain perfusion pressure.
