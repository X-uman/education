CPP = [[MAP]] - [[Intracranial pressure]] 
Cerebral blood Flow = CPP / CVR
- CVR depends upon vascular, neuronal and humoral regulators 
	- Metabolic demand of brain
	- [[pCO2]] and [[pO2]]
	- Neuronal regulation: Sympathetic activation
	- Endothelial derived factors
		- [[inhaled nitric oxide]] vs [[Endothelin-1]] 
		- [[General Anesthetics]], particularly Inhalational anesthetics INREASE Cerebral Blood flow and thus [[Intracranial pressure]]
