## Etiology and Pathophysiology

### Etiology
- [[Spinal Lesions]]
- [[Radical Hysterectomy]]
- [[Rectum Excision]] 
- [[Multiple Sclerosis]]
- [[Parkinsonism]] 
- [[Stroke]]
- 

#### Pathogenesis
- Detrusor Hyperreflexia and Phasic Contractions
- UMN Lesion (Above S2): [[detrusor instability]] and [[Detrusor Sphincter Dyssynergia]] and [[Notes/Bladder Outlet Obstruction|Bladder Outlet Obstruction]] leading to [[Overflow Incontinence]] and [[Urge Incontinence]] due to [[Clonus]] of the [[Urethral Sphincter]] 
- LMN lesions, also found in [[Spina bifida]]: Acontractile detrusor and [[Vesicoureteric Reflux]] 

## Presentation
#### Symptoms
- Sensation of filling if T11 and T12 are intact in LMN Lesions
#### Signs
- Demonstration of intact [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] and [[Anal wink reflex]] indicates that sacral cord and nerves are intact and reflex bladder contractions are likely to develop although may not be sufficient to empty the bladder
- Persistent total loss of reflexes and perineal sensation: Sacral cord or cauda equina is damaged

## Complications
#### Local
- 
#### Systemic
- 

## Diagnosis
#### Blood
- 
#### Imaging

## Management
- Objective: Prevent Upper tract damage and infections
- aseptic intermittent catheterization performed 2-3 times daily or an indwelling urethral catheter on on continuous drainage making sure patient has high urinary output (>3l/day) to combat infection
	- Condom drainage
	- Clean, intermittent, self catheterization (CISC) #search 

- Poor emptying, low bladder capacity and upper tract dilatation:
	- Endoscopic Sphincterotomy [[Achalasia]] and condom drainage
- Bladder reconstruction

- [[Urodynamic Testing]] after patient is stable

## Prognosis
- incomplete spinal cord lesion may recover somatic and bladder function
