- To inhibit cell division in body:
	- WBCs in [[Autoimmune diseases]]
	- Tumor cells
	- [[Ectopic Pregnancy]] 
	- [[Choriocarcinoma]]
	- [[Hydatidiform mole|Hydatidiform mole]] 
### Contraindications
- [[Heterotopic pregnancy]]
- Breastfeeding
- hypersensitivity
- deranged hematological, renal or hepatic laboratory values
- [[immunocompromised status]]
- [[Peptic ulcer disease]] 

### Dosage
- Treatment of ectopic pregnancy uses an intermediate MTX dose (50 mg/m2 body surface area [BSA] or 1 **mg/kg** body weight) with a maximum dose (based on the author's clinical experience) of 100 mg in patients with normal renal function. 
- However, no studies have evaluated the maximum dose of MTX in patients with ectopic pregnancy.
- By contrast, low doses (7.5 to 25 mg weekly) are typically used to treat rheumatologic disorders, and high-dose MTX (≥500 mg/m2) is used to treat some malignancies.

### ADRS
- Stomatitis
- Conjunctivitis
- Gastritis (avoid NSAIDS)
- Enteritis
- Dermatitis (avoid sun exposure)
- Pneumonitis
- Elevated LFT value
- [[Bone marrow suppression]] 
#### Consideration
- When leucovorin is administered as part of the multiple-dose MTX protocol, it is typically administered by IM injection; it can also be given orally.
