### Hepatic Steatosis
- aka Fatty Liver, completely reversible on withdrawal
- Pathophysiology:
	- Excess NADH from alcohol, Impaired lipoproteins Assembly and Secretion Increased Peripheral Fat Breakdown
	- Excess NADH–Due to Alcohol dehydrogenase and Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase
	- LP assembly–Impaired by Vitamins Deficiency seen in Chronic Alcoholics
- Gross: Enlarged Liver(4-6 kg, normally 1.5 kg), Yellow, soft, greasy texture
- Micro: lipid droplet Accumulation in hepatocytes, Perivenular Fibrosis
	- Moderate drinkers–Micro vesicular
	- Heavy chronic–Macro(>3 um), Signet ring nucleus, Initially centrilobular, Later Entire Lobule
- Clinical features
	Hepatomegaly, Mild Elevation of Bilirubin, Alkaline Po4

### Alcoholic Hepatitis: Steatohepatitis
- Patho:
	- Acetaldehyde, Oxidative Damage, Bacterial Endotoxins, Endothelin production
	- Acetaldehyde––disrupts cytoskeleton and membrane––> Neoantigens––> Immune Attack
	- Oxidative Damage––Due to Induced CYP450––> ROS, Toxic metabolites of other drugs like Acetaminophen. Methionine Metabolism––> No Glutathione
	- Bacterial Endotoxins from Gut Bacteria into Circulation–Stimulated by alcohol––> Induce Inflammation by activating NF-kB and Release of TNF, IL-6, TGF-a
	- Endothelin production by Sinusoidal Endo cells––> Stimulated by alcohol––> Contraction of Activated Myofibroblast Stellate cells––> Hypoperfusion

- Gross: 
	- normal/enlarged size, Mottled Red w/ Bile Stained areas, May show nodules
- Micro:
	- Hepatocyte swelling and necrosis–– Ballooning due to fat, water, protein accumulation in hepatocytes
	- **Mallory-Denk Bodies**–Eosinophilic inclusions in dying ballooned cells, amorphous, clumped material-made of damaged Intermediate filaments like Keratin 8, 18 + Ubiquitin, non-specific, also seen in Non-Alcoholic fatty Liver Ds, Wilson disease, 1º Biliary Cirrhosis, Cholestatic, HCC, Obesity.
	- Mallory bodies are composed of a complex of misfolded cytoskeletal elements, including several keratin types, ubiquinated keratin, heat shock proteins, the stress-induced and ubiquitin-binding protein p62, as well as other peptides (French 1981).
	- Neutrophilic Reaction around Necrotic Hepatocytes, later Lymphocytes and Macrophages also arrive
	- Fibrosis–Sclerosis of Central Veins, Perisinusoidal scar in Space of Disse, initially Centrilobular spreading outward centrifugally––Chicken Wire Fence Pattern

#### Clinical features
- Acute onset after a bout of Heavy Drinking, 15-20 years of Heavy Drinking
- Variable–mild to Acute Liver Failure
- Malaise, Anorexia, Wt. loss, U abd discomfort, Tender Hepatomegaly
- Lab:    
	- Hyperbilirubinemia, 
	- Serum Aminotransferases(AST≥2x ALT––> Alcohol Liver Damage, GGT increases in Alcohol intake also–> Induces GGTs), Alk P04, Neutrophilia

### Alcoholic Cirrhosis
- Gross: Shrinkage
- Micro: 
	- Connection of Scar from Central Vein to Portal Track–– Fibrous Septa formation, subdivision––
	- Micronodular or **Laennec Cirrhosis**, Later Macronodules appear(mixed cirrhosis) Loss of Fat, Shrinkage, Ischemic Necrosis and further scarring
### Diagnostics
- [[Chronic liver disease]] 
- S. Aminotransferases, GGT, Hyperbilirubinemia, Alkaline phosphatase
- Hypoproteinemia,
- Anemia–Fe Deficiency,
- RBCs–Burr cells(Rough Cells)
- P-HTN, Wasted Extremities, Jaundice, Death due to Hepatic Failure, Infection, Hepatorenal Syn, HCC
- Non-sp. … Malaise, Weakness, Weight loss, Anorexia
- Dx: Biopsy
