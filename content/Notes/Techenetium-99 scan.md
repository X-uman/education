- A radionuclide scan that uses technetium-99m to evaluate for bone disorders. 
- Images are captured during three phases performed over several hours. 
- If uptake occurs in all three phases, there is active inflammation in the bone (e.g., acute fracture, osteomyelitis, metastases). 
- If uptake occurs only in the first two phases, this suggests soft tissue inflammation.
