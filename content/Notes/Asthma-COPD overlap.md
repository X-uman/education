- The diagnosis of asthma-COPD overlap can be made when all of the following criteria are met: 
	- Persistent airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC < 0.7) on PFT (consistent with a diagnosis of COPD)
	- History of asthma and/or some clinical features of asthma 
	- Episodic nature of symptoms
- Individuals with asthma-COPD overlap experience more symptoms, more frequent exacerbations, and higher mortality than individuals with either asthma or COPD alone.
