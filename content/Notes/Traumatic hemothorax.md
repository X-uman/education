### Management
- Follow the ABCDE approach for trauma.
- Small (< 300 mL) or occult hemothorax : Consider chest tube insertion or conservative management.  
- All patients with moderate or large hemothoraces or those undergoing positive pressure ventilation: Insert [[Chest tube]] into the 5th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. 
- Manage other blunt chest injuries and/or penetrating chest injuries.
