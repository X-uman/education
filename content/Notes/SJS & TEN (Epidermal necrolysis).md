### Introduction
- SJS and TEN (toxic epidermal necrolysis) are the same entity but differ in terms of disease severity (based on surface area of skin involved).
	- < 10% – SJS
	- 10–30% – SJS/TEN overlap  
	- More than 30% – Toxic epidermal necrolysis or Lyell's syndrome 
### Etiology

|                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

- Risk factors
	- [[HIV]] infection
	- CYP gene polymorphisms 

### Pathophysiology
- The pathogenesis is not completely understood but is thought to involve a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (type IV): ↑ activity of drug-specific cytotoxic T cells → release of granulysin (a cytolytic protein) by an unknown mechanism → damage to keratinocytes
- [[SJS and TEN Pathogenesis.png]] 

### Presentation
- F > M 
- Symptoms take ~ 2-8 weeks after triggering agent
- Starts like a [[Viral prodrome]]
- Begins as a Rash: like [[Erythema multiforme]]
	- Skin lesions typically start on the face and trunk before spreading symmetrically to other areas. These lesions begin as painful, targetoid lesions (e.g., erythematous macules with purpuric centers) that progress to form vesicles and bullae before eventually causing extensive, full-thickness epidermal necrosis and sloughing of the skin at the dermo epidermal junction.
- [[Nikolsky sign]] +ve
- Mucosal involvement: 
	- Ocular
	- Respiratory
	- Renal
	- Genital
	- Gastrointestinal
- Thick hemorrhagic crusting 
- Sheet like epidermal separation seen in TEN
- Healing by re-epithelialization: begins 1–2 weeks after epidermal sloughing and is completed within a few weeks
- Patient may go into [[Hypovolemic shock]] or [[Septic shock]] which is usually by [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] or [[Staphylococcus aureus]]

### Diagnostics
- Clinical diagnosis
- Skin biopsy shows
	- Keratinocyte necrosis
	- Apparent sub-epidermal split
	- Eosinophilic infiltration with minimal infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes around blood vessels
- Leukopenia
- [[Hyperglycemia]] indicates worse prognosis
### Management
- Management: Similar to [[Burns]] and remove precipitating cause
- Immunosuppressants: [[Cyclosporine]] 
- [[Plasmapheresis]] 

##### SCOR-TEN for TEN patients
- The skin will SCAB during healing if one survives TEN. To recall how many factors each letter in the acronym represents, consider ‘‘S’’ to be position 0, so that ‘‘C’’ is 1, ‘‘A’’ is 2, and ‘‘B’’ is 3.
- Patients should be assessed on 1st day of hospitalization

Mortality rates for SCORTEN values

| Score     | Mortality % |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 3           |
| 2         | 12          |
| 3         | 35          |
| 4         | 58          |
| 5 or more | 90          |

### Complications
 - Pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis
- Irregular skin pigmentation, alopecia
- Ophthalmological complications: [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] (dry eyes), [[trichiasis]], synechiae between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, loss of vision
- Malnutrition
- Genital complications in females: vaginal stenosis, [[atrophic vaginitis]], dyspareunia 
### Prognosis
- Mortality rate at 1 y 
    - SJS: ∼ 25%
    - SJS/TEN overlap: ∼ 40%
    - TEN: ∼ 50%
- Factors associated with a poor prognosis
    - Old age (> 70 years)
    - Intestinal involvement
    - Pulmonary involvement
- Recurrence: SJS and/or TEN may recur with the use of the same or closely related offending drug.

### DDx: 
- [[Viral exanthemas]]: Not painful or slough
- Other drug rashes
- [[Erythema multiforme]] 
- Late TEN: 
	- [[Toxic shock syndrome]], 
	- [[SSSS- Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]] in children
