### Pathophysiology
- Basics: [[Purine metabolism]]
- Deposition of ==Monosodium urate crystals in joints==
- Primary/idiopathic: Without underlying cause
- Secondary: [[Hyperuricemia]] 
- Acute inflammation: Neutrophils phagocytose and release inflammatory mediators
- Chronic inflammation: Aggregations of Urate crystals and Giant cells as Tophi which causes deformities and arthritis

### Pathology
- [[Foreign body reaction]] 

### Presentation
- Acute presentation
- Period of latency
- Chronic presentation

### Investigations
- Consider a single hot swollen painful joint is of septic origin until proven otherwise, do [[arthrocentesis]] to rule out infection, if synovial WBC count>50,000, start on antibiotics.
- **Polarized Microscope**: shows needle shaped MSU crystals,[[negatively birefringent]] under Polarized light differentiates from [[Calcium Pyro-phosphate]]
	- Note: Needle shaped Crystals under **Electron Microscopy**: [[Calcium apatite]] 
- Other investigations:
	- [[Renal Function Tests]] 
	- Work up for [[Hyperuricemia]] after the attacks are over 
	- [[Liver function tests]] for dose adjustments of Anti-gout drugs 
	- [[Lipid profile]] for [[Metabolic syndrome]] 
	- [[Complete Blood Count]] 
	- X-ray (Not commonly done) can be normal except soft tissue swellings in 1st attack
		- In second attack it may show Erosion aka Rat bite Margin lesion (Margin sign) [[Rate bite margin lesion.png]]
	- USG: Double contour sign: a hyperechoic band of crystals covering the surface of the hypoechoic articular cartilage, which is over the hyperechoic bone contour
	- Dual-energy [[CT-scan]] for crystals in deeper structures and extra-articular sites

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Septic arthritis]]
- [[Pseudogout]] 
- [[cellulitis]]
- [[Saturnine gout]]
