According to Grahamâ€™s Law, at constant [pressure](https://byjus.com/physics/pressure/) and temperature, molecules or atoms with lower molecular mass will effuse faster than the higher molecular mass molecules or atoms. Thomas even found out the rate at which they escape through diffusion. In other words, it states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass. This formula is generally used while comparing the rates of two different gases at equal pressures and temperatures.
