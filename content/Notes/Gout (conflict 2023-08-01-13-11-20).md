[[Purine metabolism]]

#### Pathophysiology
Deposition of ==Monosodium urate crystals in joints==
Primary/idiopathic: Without underlying cause
Secondary: Due to an underlying cause (Increased production or decreased excretion)
	[[Leukemia]]: Excessive cell breakdown [[Tumor lysis syndrome]]
	Renal diseases: Decreased excretion
	Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome

### Presentation
1. Acute presentation:
	- Acute [[Inflammation]] of first Metatarsophalangeal joint or [[Arthritis]] (Great toe) (Podagra)
2. Chronic presentation
	- Skin ulceration in joint area
	- Adjacent Joint destruction
	- Tophi appearing as chalky-white deposits

#### Investigations
- Consider a single hot swollen painful joint is of septic origin until proven otherwise, do [[arthrocentesis]] to rule out infection, if synovial WBC count>50000, start on antibiotics.
- #microscopy shows needle shaped MSU crystals, birefrigent under Polarized light differentiates from [[Calcium Pyro-phosphate]]
- Other investigations:
	- [[Renal Function Tests]]
	- 24 hour urate excretion: To estimate risk for renal stones, normally less than 800
	- [[Liver function tests]]
	- Serum lipids
	- [[Complete Blood Count]]

- #### Management
- Acute presentation
	- [[Anti-inflammatory drugs]]: NSAIDS, Steroids, resolution of sign and symptoms occurs in 5-8 days. Most effective are Indomethaxin, Naproxen, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac
	- [[Colchicine]] #contraindications in Dialysis patients
	
- Chronic gout: Anti-gout drugs
	- First line: Allopurinol along with low dose Colchicine to reduce flare while urate levels lower down and patient is attack free for 6 months
	- [[Purine metabolism]]
