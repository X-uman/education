### Layers
- Conscious mind
- Preconscious mind which represses memories/drives into unconscious mind, which can express themselves as [[Dreams]] which allow unacceptable impulses and desires to reach conscious mind
- Unconscious mind
	- Primary process thinking: immediate wish fulfillment and instinctual discharges 
	- Illogical and contradictory 

### Accessing unconscious mind 
- Interpretation of dreams
- Unguided communications
	- Slips of tongue or parapraxis 
	- Abreaction: recalling memory with release of emotions
- Transference: feeling patient develops for doctor and for some figure from past
- Counter transference: feeling therapist develops for patient
