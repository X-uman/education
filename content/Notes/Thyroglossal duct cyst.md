### Clinical presentation
- Painless, firm, midline neck mass that elevates with swallowing and tongue protrusion
- Usually located near the hyoid bone 
- May cause dysphagia or neck/throat pain if the cyst enlarges
#### Locations
- Lingual thyroid
- Suprahyoid
- Hyoid
- Infrahyoid 

### Diagnostics
- USG of neck
- CECT neck: preferred
	- Thyroglossal duct cysts are demonstrated as well-defined lesions with homogenous fluid attenuation and surrounding rim enhancement, typically close to the hyoid bone.
	- Allows for assessment of anatomical location, relation, and extent of the cyst as well as its relation to normal orthotopic thyroid tissue.
- [[Thyroid function tests]] 
	- A solid mass or elevated TSH suggests hypothyroidism. 
	- Patients with hypothyroidism should undergo thyroid scintigraphy to rule out an ectopic thyroid. 
	- If all of a patient's functional thyroid tissue is located within the cyst, thyroid replacement therapy will be required.
- If an infection is suspected, fine needle aspiration should be performed for Gram stain and culture (including AFB and mycobacterial culture).
### Management
- Elective surgical excision ([[Sistrunk procedure]]) to prevent infection: includes removal of the cyst, a portion of the hyoid bone, and excision of tissue comprising the path of descent from the foramen cecum
- Treatment of any active infection with antibiotics before surgery

### Complications
- Infection with abscess formation
- Sinus tract formation
- Ectopic thyroid tissue and malignancy arising from it
