- [[PTrP]] analogue used in Osteoporosis
	- Teriparatide
	- Abaloparatide
### Mechanism
- Normally secreted when serum iron goes down
- Effect of PTH on bone → ↑ bone resorption → ↑ release of calcium phosphate → ↑ calcium levels
- Induces RANKL expression in osteoblasts → binding of RANKL to RANK on osteoclasts → activation of osteoclasts
- Induces [[Interleukin-1]] expression in osteoblasts → activation of osteoclasts
- Effect of PTH on the kidneys → ↑ phosphate excretion (phosphaturia)
