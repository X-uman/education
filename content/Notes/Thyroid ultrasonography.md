| Risk pattern  | Findings                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| High          | Solid hypoechoic nodule or solid hypoechoic component with at least 1 of following: <br>Irregular margins, taller-than-wide shape, micro-calcifications, rim calcifications, extra-thyroid extension | Estimated risk of malignancy > 10%<br><br> |
| Intermediate  | Solid hypoechoic nodule without high-risk features                                                                                                                                                   | Estimated risk of malignancy > 10%<br><br> |
| Low risk      | Isoechoic or hyperechoic solid nodule<br>Cystic nodule with eccentric solid component                                                                                                                |                                            |
| Very low risk | Partially cystic nodule<br>Spongiform nodule                                                                                                                                                         |                                            |
| Benign        | Cystic nodules (anechoic) without solid component                                                                                                                                                    |                                            |
- Thyroid ultrasound is not a screening test for the general population. It is indicated as initial test for patients with palpable thyroid nodules or clinical suspicion for thyroid malignancy.
- Solid, hypoechoic nodules with irregular margins, micro-calcifications, taller-than-wide shape, extrathyroidal growth, and/or cervical lymphadenopathy should raise suspicion for malignancy and require further evaluation with FNAC.
