| I             | Medullary Endosteal disease                                                                |
| II            | Superficial Cortical surface infected because of coverage defect                           |
| III           | Localized Cortical sequestrum that can be excised without compromising stability           |
| IV            | Diffuse Features of I, II, and III plus mechanical instability before or after debridement |

| Physiologic Class | Description                                                                                                |

| A                 | Normal Immunocompetent with good local vascularity                                                           |
| B                 | Compromised Local (L) or systemic (S) factors that compromise immunity or healing ([[delayed wound healing]]) |
| C                 | Prohibitive Minimal disability, prohibitive morbidity anticipated, or poor prognosis for cure (Treatment worse than disease) |
