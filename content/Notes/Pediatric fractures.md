### Types
| Type of Fracture                   | Differentiating Points                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Torus or buckling fracture.png]] | - Incomplete fracture<br>- Bone buckles or bulges outwards without breaking opposite side<br>- Typically occurs in children at metaphysis<br>- Often caused by compression forces<br>- Usually does not require manipulation |
| [[Plastic deformation.png]]        | - Not a true fracture<br>- Bone changes shape due to bending forces<br>- No complete breakage of bone<br>- Can result in bone bowing<br>- Common in children                                                                 |
| [[Greenstick fracture.png]]        | - Incomplete fracture<br>- Bone partially broken<br>- One side fractured, other side bent<br>- Common in children<br>- Bones more flexible<br>- Resembles a green branch partially broken but not snapped completely         |
### Toddler's fracture
- Seen in < 2 y
- Often **no prior history of trauma**, but reluctance to bear weight
- Tenderness + 
- X-ray: a spiral or oblique Undisplaced fracture of the distal shaft of the tibia with an intact fibula.
- Management: 
	- Immobilization using knee long-leg cast for 3 weeks then 2 weeks in short leg walking cast with weight bearing as tolerated
	- Rule out possibility of [[Child abuse]]
