- investigation of choice for measuring depth of burns is [[Laser Flowmetry]]

| Type              | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                         | Healing Time | Scar Formation                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Superficial       | - Painful <br> - Redness <br> - Blanching on pressure <br> - Heals without scars in 7 days                                                                                              | 7 days       | None                               |
| Partial thickness | - Blisters <br> - Superficial: Painful blisters, blanches on pressure, superficial touch and pin prick both present <br> - Deep: Painless blisters, blanching absent, pin prick present | 3-5 weeks    | Superficial: None<br>Deep: Present |
| Full thickness    | - Eschar present <br>- Circumferential eschar can cause [[Compartment syndrome]] and [[contractures]]<br>- Both superficial touch and ==pinprick sensation absent==                     | Variable     | Present                            |
| Deep burns        | Involving muscles, bones                                                                                                                                                                | Variable     | Present                            |

### Grades 
- [[Body surface area.jpg]]
- [[Parkland Formula]] 
- Wallace rule (9 rule) 
- Palmar rule 
- [[Lund and Browder's chart]] is best for children, most practical 
- Berkow formula
	- for infant, Head and neck surface is 21% a/c to it

### Management
Certainly, here's the information organized into a table based on the percentage of burn surface area:

| Percentage of Burn Surface Area                                                                                                              | Actions                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| More than 20% partial thickness (>10 years)<br>More than 10% partial thickness (<10 years)<br>More than 5% full thickness in any age<br><br> | Admission for monitoring and management                                    |
| Inhalation injury suspected or burns involve > 30% TBSA                                                                                      | - Endotracheal intubation if necessary <br> - Admission to ICU/Burn center |
| 2ndA-degree burns involving > 10% of TBSA<br>3rd-degree burns involving > 5% of TBSA                                                         | - Admission to ICU/Burn center                                             |
