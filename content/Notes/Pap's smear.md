- Projected end of the Ayre’s spatula is inserted and rotated 3600 around the squamocolumnar junction to collect material for screening
- The cytobrush takes endocervical sampling for screening
- For cytohormonal study the rounded end of the spatula is used and material is collected from the lateral vaginal fornix.
- The collected material is immediately spread over a slide. Fixative (95% ethyl alcohol) is spread over it.
- Once dried up, the slide is then stained either with papanicolaou or sorr’s method and it is examined under the microscopy.
