- [[Placenta accreta]] ([[Placenta previa]] generally manifests with placenta accreta. )
- [[Placenta increta]]
- [[Placenta percreta]]: [[Hematuria]] 

### Natural history
- Damaged [[Endometrium]]: [[Myometrium]] is exposed
- Excessive [[trophoblastic invasion]] (Compare [[Preeclampsia]])
- [[Retained conceptus]]: [[Puerperal Sepsis]] 
- [[Delivery variables.canvas|Postpartum hemorrhage]]
- Chronic: [[Notes/Abnormal uterine bleeding]] 

### Risk factors
- [[Compromised endometrium]] 
- Invasion beyond level of decidua due to absence of Nitabuch's membrane.
- Based on depth of invasion: a) Placenta accreta: Not too deeply into myometrium, b) Placenta increta: Too deeply into the myometrium, c) Placenta percreta: Also invades other organs like urinary bladder.
### Investigations 
-  Clinical diagnosis: See “Clinical features” above.
- [[USG]]
	- Thinning of uterine myometrial wall
	- Placental lacunae (particularly irregularly shaped), giving the placenta a **moth-eaten appearance**
	- Disruption of the junction between the bladder wall and uterine serosa
	- Loss of clear space behind the placenta

- Specific to placenta increta/percreta
	- Increased number of placental vessels extend beyond the myometrium into another serosa
	- Focal mass of placental tissue extending through the uterine serosa into adjacent organs
- Doppler ultrasonography: confirmatory imaging
	- Shows turbulent blood flow 
	- Increased myometrial vascularity like [[Fibroid uterus]] 
- MRI: performed if ultrasound studies are inconclusive
### Management
- [[Dilation and evacuation]]
- [[Cesarean hysterectomy]] 
- Uterine preserving measures are relatively contraindicated
