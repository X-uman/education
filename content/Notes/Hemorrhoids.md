### Pathophysiology
- Increased intraluminal pressure
	- [[Constipation]] 
### Presentation
- [[per rectal bleeding]] (Only bleeding, no prolapsing mass: Grade 1)
	- color: fresh
	- amount: variable
	- timing: after feces passed out
	- associated: just after passing feces
- Prolapsing mass is enlarged distended anal cushion
	- Self reducing: Grade 2
	- Manually reducible: Grade 3
	- comes back again after reducing/permanently prolapsed: Grade 4: Incarcerated, distended, painful rupture, then bleeding
- Pain when incarcerated, but not usually present
- Pruritus/irritation around anal opening due to leakage of fecal matter

### Examination/signs
- Inspection: Prolapsing mass at anal opening may be there, excoriations
	- Anoscope: Prolapsing mass at 3, 7, and 11 o'clock positions commonly
- Palpation/ [[Per rectal examination]]: palpable mass

### Diagnostics
- Clinical examination can be sufficient for diagnosis 
- Anoscope
- sigmoidoscopy R/O malignancy
- colonoscopy R/O malignancy 
- [[Coagulation panel]] R/O [[Bleeding diasthesis]] 
- Colorectal cancer must be ruled out in a patient presenting with rectal bleeding, even if the patient has a history of hemorrhoids.
### Complications:
- [[Lower GI Bleeding]] or [[per rectal bleeding]]: [[Anemia]] 
- Acute pain in hemorrhoids can be due to following complications
	- Ulceration, infection
	- Thrombosis, gangrene 
- Chronic inflammation: [[fibrosis]] and [[Anal stricture]] 
- Infection: [[portal pyemia]] or [[sepsis]]
