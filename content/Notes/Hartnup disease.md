 - **Definition**: inherited genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the renal and intestinal transport of neutral amino acids (e.g., [[tryptophan]]) 
- **Epidemiology**: incidence is 1:30,000 
- **Etiology**: mutation in the SLC6A19 gene
- **Inheritance**: [[autosomal recessive]]
- **Pathophysiology**: impaired Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporter on enterocytes and proximal renal tubular cells → decreased renal and intestinal absorption of [[tryptophan]] → inability to synthesize [[Vitamin B3 (Niacin)]] 
- **Clinical features**: symptoms of [[Vitamin B3 (Niacin)]] deficiency
	- [[Pellagra]]: dermatitis, glossitis, diarrhea, dementia
    - Decreased [[Serotonin]]: [[Cerebellar ataxia]] 
- **Diagnostics**: ↑ neutral amino acids in urine (neutral aminoaciduria)
- **Treatment**
    - High-protein diet 
	- Niacin supplementation
