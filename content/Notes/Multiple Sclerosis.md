### Risk factors
- HLA-DR2 gene
- [[EBV]] infection 
### Pathogenesis
- CNS inflammation, demyelination and axonal degeneration

### Presentation
- F > M at 20-40 y.o. 
- #commonest is [[Optic Neuritis]]
- #commonest physical finding is [[Spasticity (vs rigidity)]] due to [[UMN Lesions]] 
- Absent Abdominal reflex: Early sign 
- Charcot's triad:
	- [[dysarthria]]
	- Intention tremor
	- Nystagmus 
- Involvement of [[Median Longitudinal Fasciculus]] 
- Lhermitte sign 
- [[Neuropathic pain]] 
- [[Cranial nerve palsies]]
- [[Autonomic neuropathy]] 
- Cognitive disturbance late finding 
- [[Cerebellar signs]] 
- [[Transverse myelitis]] 
- Headache, fatigue 
### Investigations
- #ioc is CE-[[MRI]] brain and spinal cord
	- White Matter Lesions like Dawson Fingers appear enhanced up to 6 weeks after exacerbations 
	- T2 and FLAIR hyperintense lesions found in both hemisphere
	- T1: may look darker 
	- Contrast enhancement usually resolves after 2-8 weeks
- [[MacDonald criteria]] 
- #obsolete  [[Lumbar Puncture]]: 
	- Oligoclonal bands (3% of patients whom MRI is equivocal)
	- Lymphocytic pleocytosis 
- #obsolete Visual and Auditory Evoked Potentials: Increased latency time 
- CSF Analysis: Ig-G index = (CSF Ig-G/Serum Ig-G)/(CSF albumin/Serum albumin)
	- IgG index < 0.7 (normally)
	- Increase in IgG without increase in Albumin suggest local Ig production
		- [[Multiple Sclerosis]]
		- [[Subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis]] 
### Management
- Acute Episode: 
	- [[Glucocorticoids]], [[Fludrocortisone]]? or
	- [[Plasmapheresis]] or IV [[Cyclophosphamide]] or [[ACTH]] 
- Long term: As early as possible to slow disease progression
	- [[Disease modifying MS therapy]]
	- [[Vitamin D]]
	- Stop smoking
- Manage [[Spasticity (vs rigidity)]], Pain, [[Autonomic dysfunction]] 
- [[Pemoline]] ? [[Infliximab]]? 
- dalfampridine for walking difficulties 
### Differential Diagnosis
- [[Neuromyelitis optica spectrum]]
- [[Acute disseminated Encephalomyelitis]]
- [[Transverse myelitis]] 
- [[Vasculitis]]
- Infections
	- [[Neurosyphilis]]
	- [[Neuroborreliosis]]
	- [[Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy]]
	- [[HIV encephalopathy]]
