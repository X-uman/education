### Pathological features:
- Rokitanksy-Aschoff sinuses: as in [[Ulcerative colitis]], reactive mucosal regeneration
- Cholesterol laden [[Macrophages]] in lamina propria Cholesterolosis
- [[dystrophic calcification]]: porcelain gallbladder on X-ray
- Â Xanthogranulomatous variant: Intramural accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages, mistaken for [[Biliary carcinoma]] on imaging

- Infection, abscess, perforation, peritonitis
- [[cholecystoenteric fistula]] due to pressure necrosis of large gallstone, [[Gallstone ileus]] and [[bowel obstruction]]
