### Etiology 
- [[Airway obstructions]]
- [[Ciliary dysfunction syndromes]] 
- [[immunocompromised status]] 
- [[Traction bronchiectasis]] 
- Chronic infections
	- [[Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]]
	- [[necrotizing pneumonia]]
- [[graft-versus-host disease]] 
### Pathology
- Vertical airways usually involved, less clearance
- [[Inflammation]] 
	- Acute: Ulceration
	- Chronic: [[Peribronchiolar fibrosis]], Squamous [[Metaplasia]] 
- [[Hemophilus influenzae]] found in 50% cases
- [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] 
- [[Non tubercular mycobacterium]]: MAC is commonest

### Presentation
- WHY MORNING COUGH? On Standing up, secretions fall down the airways
- Very foul smelling copious sputum
- [[Dyspnea]]  
- [[clubbing]] 
- Dry bronchiectasis: Manifested by episodic hemoptysis
- [[wheezes]]
- Pleuritic chest pain
- [[Recurrent pneumonia]] 

### Types
- Generalized/focal
- Congenital/acquired
- Cystic fibrosis associated or not
- Associated with fibrosis: Traction bronchiectasis
- Without expectorant: Dry 

### Diagnostics
- Most sensitive:[[HRCT Chest]] 
	- Tram-track appearance
	- Signet ring appearance
	- tree-in-bud pattern
	- Cysts in bronchial wall
	- Bronchial cross section > 1.5 x normal
	- Tubular structures within 1 cm from pleural surface
- [[Ciliary dysfunction syndromes]] 
### Management
- Improve clearance of secretions
	- Chest physiotherapy
	- Hydration and [[expectorants and mucolytics]] 
	- Aerosol Hypertonic saline
- Antibiotics
	- Provide coverage for pseudomonas, staphylococcus and streptococci
- Anti-inflammatory: [[Macrolides]] 
- Relieve Airway obstruction
	- Bronchodilators
- Surgery for refractory cases
- Treat [[Massive hemoptysis]]
