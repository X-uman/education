### Pathogenesis
| **Step**                                   | **Interactions**                                                                                                 | [[Anti-retroviral therapy]]            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| HIV enters the body                        | - Entry via mucosal lesions or infection of mucosal/cutaneous immune cells.                                      |                                      |
|                                            | - Attachment to CD4 receptor on host cells with its gp120 glycoprotein.                                          | [[Fusion inhibitors]]                |
| Cells that have CD4 receptors              | - T lymphocytes (e.g., T helper cells).                                                                          |                                      |
|                                            | - Macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells.                                                                       |                                      |
| Viral envelope fuses with host cell        | - Fusion requires presence of CD4 receptor and a coreceptor (CCR5 in macrophages, and CCR5 or CXCR4 in T-cells). | [[CCR5 receptor inhibitors]]         |
| Viral entry into macrophages               | - Via CCR5 mainly occurs during early stages of infection.                                                       |                                      |
|                                            | - Entry via CXCR4 occurs in later stages.                                                                        |                                      |
| Resistance to HIV                          | - Individuals without CCR5 receptors appear to be resistant to HIV.                                              |                                      |

| Viral RNA transcribed into dsDNA           | - Done by viral reverse transcriptase.                                                                           | [[Reverse transcriptase inhibitors]] |
| Viral DNA integrated into host's DNA       | - Done by viral integrase.                                                                                       | [[Integrase inhibitors]]             |
| Viral DNA replication and virions assembly | - Viral DNA replication occurs.                                                                                  |                                      |
|                                            | - Virions are assembled, Synthesizing Structural Proteins of Virus                                               | [[Protease inhibitors]]              |
| Virion budding                             | - Repurposes a portion of the cell's membrane as an envelope.                                                    |                                      |
|                                            | - Leaves the cell through budding.                                                                               |                                      |
| Cell death                                 | - Occurs after virion leaves the cell.                                                                           |                                      |
