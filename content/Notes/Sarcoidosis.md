- Hilar [[Lymphadenopathy]]
- Central nodular opacities
### Clinical Findings:
- Parotid swelling usually bilateral
- Parotid swelling + Uveitis + Facial paralysis with fever is called Heerfordt's disease or uveoparotid fever. SM and SL glands may also be affected
- [[Diabetes insipidus]] due to pituitary involvement
- Angel Wing appearance due to Bilateral Hilar LAN
- Heart: [[Restrictive cardiomyopathy]] 
- Muscle involvement may be there manifesting as weakness, aches, tenderness, fatigue, which can be diagnosed by biopsy
- Sarcoid granuloma may occur in heart, kidneys, CNS, and endocrine, particularly Pituitary gland
- Mikulicz syndrome means Combined Uveoparotid involvement bilaterally
- Granulomatous leptomeningitis involves multiple cranial nerves
- Lymph nodes of tonsils may be affected in 25% of cases

### Laboratory Findings:
- Elevated calcium levels: [[a1-hydroxylase activity]] is increased
- Anergy to Candida or PPD antigens so negative [[Mantoux test]] 
- Polyclonal [[hypergammaglobulinemia]] which is a manifestation of T-helper cell proliferation

### Imaging Findings:
- Schumann bodies and asteroid bodies are not pathognomonic of Sarcoidosis
- In lungs, granulomas tend to be distributed along lymphatics round bronchi and blood vessels, so bronchial submucosal biopsy has high diagnostic yield
- Granulomas may occur in the bones, particularly in phalangeal bones of hands and feet, creating small circumscribed areas of bone resorption and diffuse reticulated pattern throughout the bone marrow cavity, widening of bony shafts, or new bone formation on the outer surfaces. leading to [[Clubbing]]
