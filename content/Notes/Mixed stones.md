- Risk factors: bacterial infections and parasites (e.g., [[Clonorchis sinensis]], [[Opisthorchis species]]) in the biliary tract,[[ sclerosing cholangitis]]
- Pathophysiology: infection or infestation → release of β-[[glucuronidase]] (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) → hydrolyzes conjugated bilirubin and lecithin in the bile → increased unconjugated bilirubin and fatty acids → precipitation of calcium carbonate, cholesterol, and calcium bilirubinate (dark color) in bile
