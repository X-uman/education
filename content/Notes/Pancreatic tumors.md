### Approach
| Clinical Scenario                                      | Diagnostic Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unexplained epigastric pain, RUQ pain, and/or jaundice | - Initial imaging: Abdomen ultrasound <br> - Laboratory studies: Liver chemistries, lipase, and amylase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| High clinical suspicion for abdominal malignancy       | - Initial imaging: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast <br> - Laboratory studies: Liver chemistries, lipase, and amylase                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Indeterminate pancreatic lesions on imaging            | - Initial imaging: Pancreas protocol imaging (CT or MRI) <br> - Consider advanced testing (e.g., EUS, MRCP) based on findings or if the diagnosis remains uncertain <br> - Arrange tissue sampling for histopathology in most patients <br>Pancreatic [[incidentalomas]] should be investigated early and evaluated for curative resection. |
| Confirmed pancreatic malignancy                        | - Preoperative staging imaging to assess local and distant spread and determine resectability <br> - Measure baseline tumor markers <br> - Perform genetic testing for individuals with a positive family history or suspected genetic syndrome <br> - Additional testing as indicated based on individual patient factors                  |
- CT with PO water and IV contrast; pancreas-specific triphasic protocol) to confirm USG findings, or if clinical suspicion remains high despite negative USG or as an initial imaging modality for pain and weight loss as initial symptoms
