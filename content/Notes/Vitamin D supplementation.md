- Children: ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol 2000–6000 IU/day (dose depends on age) administered for at least 12 weeks; adults: ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol 50,000 IU/week PO for 8–12 weeks or 3 times a week for 1 month
- Sun exposure is not recommended to prevent vitamin D deficiency because of the risk of skin cancer. 
- calcitriol plays no role in building up vitamin D stores and should not be used for patients without symptomatic hypocalcemia

### Prevention of deficiency

- Supplementation should be continued until the infant is weaned and drinks at least 33 ounces (1 liter) of vitamin D-fortified formula (or vitamin D-fortified cow's milk or fortified plant-based milk, if the infant is older than 12 months). 
- Other dietary sources of vitamin D for older children include certain solid foods (oily fish, eggs, and fortified foods). 
- However, the intake from these sources tends to be low and inconsistent, so it is best to rely on either supplements or vitamin D-fortified formula, cow's milk, or plant-based milk to supply vitamin D requirements.
- The administration of moderately high doses of vitamin D (4000 to 6400 international units (100 to 160 micrograms) daily) to the lactating mother is another strategy to raise 25-OHD concentrations in exclusively breastfed infants instead of giving supplements to the infant

### Stoss therapy
- Short-term administration of high-dose vitamin D, known as "stoss therapy," is an effective alternative and can be a good solution for patients who do not adhere to oral therapy. 
- Stoss therapy should not be used for young infants (<3 months of age), and careful dosing is important to avoid risks of hypercalcemia
