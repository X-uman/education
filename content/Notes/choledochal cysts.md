### Definition
- A rare **premalignant** condition characterized by extrahepatic and/or intrahepatic cystic dilation of the biliary tree.

#### Epidemiology
- More common in individuals of Asian, particularly Japanese, descent
- Female predominance (3:1)
- Most commonly diagnosed during childhood (although 25–50% are diagnosed in adulthood)

### Etiology
- Exact cause unknown
- Pancreaticobiliary maljunction thought to play a role in the majority of cases
#### Pathophysiology
1. Pancreaticobiliary maljunction leads to the formation of a long common channel.
2. Reflux and activation of pancreatic secretions in the common bile duct cause inflammation and elevation of intraductal pressure→ cystic degeneration
3. **Chronic reflux and ductal inflammation** lead to dysplasia and malignancy.
4. **Dilated cysts cause bile stasis, sludge and stone formation, obstruction, ascending cholangitis, ductal strictures, and secondary biliary cirrhosis.**

#### Clinical Features
- Symptoms typically develop before the **age of 10**
- Classic triad of abdominal pain, palpable abdominal mass, and jaundice present in < 30% of affected individuals
- Clinical presentation varies with age:
    - Children ≤ 12 months: obstructive jaundice and abdominal mass
    - Children > 12 months and adults: right upper quadrant pain (most common), fever, and nausea
- First manifestation can be one of the complications listed below.

#### Diagnostics
- **Laboratory Studies:**
    - **CBC**: Leukocytosis if cholangitis or pancreatitis is there due to choledochal cyst obstruction 
    - **LFTs**: Evidence of cholestasis, elevated ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin; ALT and AST may also be elevated
    - Elevated amylase and lipase in pancreatitis
- **Imaging:**
    - **Ultrasound**: Initial modality of choice, shows choledochal cysts and/or dilation of the common bile duct
    - **CT abdomen**: Higher sensitivity than ultrasound; better visualization of intrahepatic ducts, distal common bile duct, and pancreatic head
    - **Cholangiography**: Essential for diagnosis confirmation, identification of associated ductal pathology, and surgical planning
	    - **MRCP**: Method of choice for preoperative imaging
	    - **ERCP**: Better visualization of pancreaticobiliary junction and distal biliary tree
	    - [[Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography]]: Better visualization of cysts in the proximal biliary tree
- [[Choledochal cysts classification]] 
#### Treatment
- **Complete excision** of the choledochus, cholecystectomy, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for most cysts. (remove everything because it is a **precancerous lesion**)
- Individuals with biliary cysts have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma; therefore, all patients should undergo surgery, even if asymptomatic. 

#### Complications
1. Cholangitis
2. Pancreatitis
3. Secondary biliary cirrhosis
4. Cyst rupture and bile [[peritonitis]]
5. Malignancy: 
	- **Risk of cholangiocarcinoma is 20–30×** higher than in the general population, surveillance required postoperatively.
