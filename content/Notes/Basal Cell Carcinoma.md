### Introduction
- Tumor arising from [[keratinocytes]] 
- Commonest malignant skin tumor
---
### Etiology
- UV exposure: commonly tumor located in head and neck
- [[immunocompromised status]] 
- Genetic predisposition
	- Albinism
	- Xeroderma pigmentosum
	- Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome
---
### Pathogenesis
- [[Sonic hedgehog pathway]] affecting basal keratinocytes, hair follicles and eccrine sweat glands

----
### Epidemiology


---
### Clinical presentation  
- Non-healing ulcers/plaque/nodule which may easily bleed
- Location: commonly sun-exposed area
- Advanced lesions often have central ulceration
- Indolent growth 
- [[perineural invasion]] can occur in high risk types
- [[Dermoscopy]]
- Metastasis: rare
#### Clinical signs


---
### Diagnostics
- Full body skin examination
- Dermoscopy can support visual inspection
- [[Skin biopsy]] 
	- Microscopic features: Palisading nuclei 
### Classification
##### Low risk types
| Subtype                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Location                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nodular basal cell carcinoma     | - Most common subtype, comprising 50-80% of BCC cases<br>- Presents as a shiny, pearl-like papule or nodule<br>- Borders are typically rolled<br>- Central depression, erosion, or ulceration may be present (rodent ulcer)<br>- Superficial telangiectasias with arborizing pattern  | Face, especially the nose                                                                             |
| Superficial basal cell carcinoma | - Second most frequent subtype, accounting for 10-30% of BCC cases<br>- Presents as a thin, scaly plaque<br>- Borders are raised with a pearl-like appearance<br>- Central atrophy may be present<br>- Predominantly located on the trunk and legs<br>- Least invasive subtype of BCC | Trunk and legs                                                                                        |
| Pigmented basal cell carcinoma   | - Can be nodular or superficial BCC lesion containing melanin<br>- Manifests as a blue, brown, or black lesion                                                                                                                                                                        | Variable, may occur on any part of the body but often on sun-exposed areas, may resemble [[Melanoma]] |
##### High risk types (~20%)

| Subtype      | Description                                                     | Other Features                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Micronodular | Erythematous macule, thin papule, or plaque                     |                                         |
| Infiltrative | Poorly defined flat or depressed light-colored papule or plaque | Induration, ulceration, crust formation |
| Morpheaform  | Poorly defined, shiny plaque                                    | Can resemble a scar                     |

### Management
- Primary prevention: [[Sun protection]] 

| Risk       | Methods                                     | Consideration                                                           |

|            | Curettage and Electrodessication            | Contraindicated in cosmetically sensitive areas, deeper lesions         |

|            | Radiotherapy                                | Typically used for adults > 60 years of age if resection not feasible   |
|            | Cryotherapy and/or [[Photodynamic therapy]] | Low risk superficial if resection/cryotherapy not feasible<br>          |
|            | Topical drugs                               | [[Imiquimod]] and [[5-Flurouracil]]                                     |
