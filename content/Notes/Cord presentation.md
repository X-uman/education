### Management
- **Patients at Very High Risk of Cord Prolapse (F)**:
    - Unlikely to benefit from expectant management, especially with polyhydramnios present.
    - Offer induction of labor by "needling" the membranes in a controlled environment.
    - Anesthesia team ready for emergency cesarean delivery in case of cord prolapse.
- **Patients at Increased Risk of Cord Prolapse (Vertex Descended, Cervix Not Significantly Dilated, Normal Amniotic Fluid Volume)**:
    - Advise to come to the labor and delivery unit as soon as labor begins for cord position evaluation.
    - Continue labor with goal of vaginal delivery if funic presentation has resolved.
    - If funic presentation is confirmed, monitor patient/fetal heart rate continuously, perform controlled amniotomy with anesthesia team ready for emergency cesarean delivery if cord prolapse occurs.
    - Cesarean delivery without a trial of labor is also reasonable in this scenario.
