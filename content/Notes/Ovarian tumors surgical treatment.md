| Surgical Procedure                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surgical staging                                  | To obtain pathological specimens and evaluate the extent of cancer spread (see “Stages” above)                                                                                                             |
| Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy | Removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries on both sides to treat and prevent the spread of ovarian cancer                                                                                        |
| Pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection       | Removal and examination of lymph nodes in the pelvic and paraaortic regions to determine the extent of cancer spread                                                                                       |
| Omentectomy                                       | Removal of the omentum, a fatty tissue covering the abdominal organs, to remove cancerous cells and prevent further spread                                                                                 |
| Peritoneal cytology                               | Collection and examination of peritoneal fluid for the presence of cancer cells, aiding in the diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer                                                                     |
| Surgical debulking                                | Maximal cytoreduction, removing visible tumor tissue, to improve long-term outcomes                                                                                                                        |
| Optimal debulking                                 | Defined as achieving < 1 cm of residual tumor after surgery, typically used in disease stages I–III, and occasionally in stage IV to remove as much tumor tissue as possible for better treatment outcomes |
