### Properties of amniotic fluids
- Alkaline (Nitrazine paper becomes Blue from yellow)
- Salty (Fern test)
- Contains fetal skin cells (Nile blue sulfate test stains fat containing cells from sebaceous glands)
- Contains [[Alpha Fetoprotein]]
- IGF Binding protein (IGF BP-1) 
- placental alpha-microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) test: [[Immunochromatography]] (Amnisure)
### Markers
- Fetal [[Fibronectin]]: [[glycoprotein]] present in decidual interface
	- More than 50 ng/ml: Likely patient goes to [[Preterm labor]] 
	- A test used to measure the level of fibronectin, a protein that attaches the fetal amniotic sac to the uterus. An increased fetal fibronectin (fFN) concentration in cervicovaginal fluid may indicate an increased risk of preterm birth. Often used in conjunction with cervical length measurement.
