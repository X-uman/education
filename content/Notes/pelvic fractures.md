### Mechanism of injury
- AP compression
- Lateral compression
- Vertical shear forces: like falling on 1 leg
- [[Pelvic fracture classification]] 

### Presentation
- Pelvic pain
- Reduced ROM of Hip joint
- Pelvic instability on [[Pelvic stability assessment]] 
	- Movement in any direction
	- Rotational instability: Laxity of internal rotation or external rotation may be present.
	- Vertical instability: Limb length discrepancy or asymmetry of the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) may be present.
- Labial, scrotal, flank, and inguinal hematomas 
### Management
- [[Primary survey]] and Pelvic binding
- Bedside X-ray for suspected instability
- Stable patients: Obtain CECT of pelvis
- Suspected genitourinary injuries
	- [[Retrograde Urethrogram]]
	- Avoid [[Foley's catheter]]; consider [[suprapubic catheterization]] instead 
##### Unstable patients: 
- Signs of intraperitoneal hemorrhage: Emergency [[Exploratory laparotomy]] 
- [[Hemorrhage control]] 

| Measures            | Examples                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Temporizing measure | External: [[Pelvic binder]], External fixation, Pelvic C-clamp<br>Internal: [[damage control surgery]]        |
| Angioembolization   | Hemodynamic instability despite mechanical pelvic stabilization, <br>and/or evidence of active bleeding on CT |
<br>
### Diagnostics
- X-ray pelvis: useful for bedside screening for unstable patients
- CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is the gold standard
	- Fracture signs
	- [[Vascular injuries]]
	- [[Hemoperitoneum]]
	- [[Pneumoperitoneum]] 

### Treatment
- Stable fracture: Non-operative management
	- Non-weight bearing exercise
	- [[Pain management]]
	- Physiotherapy
	- [[Thromboprophylaxis]]
- Unstable fractures: surgical repair
- Additional surgeries for surrounding tissue injuries

### Complications
- [[Urethral injury]]
- [[Retroperitoneal hematoma]]
- [[Hemorrhagic shock]]
- [[Urinary bladder injury]]
- [[Perineal injury]]
- Neurovascular injury: Decreased anal tone, perianal parasthesia 
- Axial and long bone injuries 
- [[Abdominal compartment syndrome]]
- Bladder/sexual dysfunction
