### Diagnostics 
- Diagnostic criteria: All criteria must be fulfilled.
	   - Presence of liver disease
	   - Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation detected on [[contrast echocardiography]]
	   - Abnormal arterial oxygenation confirmed by elevated [[A-a gradient]]
- Pulse oximetry (screening test): Hypoxemia and [[Platypnea]]  
- Imaging
    - Contrast echocardiogram (gold standard) 
	- Lung perfusion scintigraphy (Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin): helps diagnose and quantify intrapulmonary vasodilation

### Treatment
- [[Oxygen therapy]] to maintain sPO2 > 88%
- [[Oxygenation]] monitoring
- Definitive: [[Liver transplantation]]
