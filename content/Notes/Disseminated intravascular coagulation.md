- Causes Consumption coagulopathy
- Consumption of platelets and coagulation factors
### Etiology
1. [[sepsis]]: Systemic infection, particularly severe bacterial infections, can trigger DIC. The infection causes the release of procoagulant substances, activates the clotting cascade, and leads to widespread clotting and subsequent consumption of clotting factors. 
3. Obstetric Complications
	- [[placental abruption]], 
	- [[amniotic fluid embolism]], or
	- [[septic abortion]]. 
	- [[Severe preeclampsia.png]] 
	- [[IUFD]] 
5. Major Trauma: Severe trauma, such as extensive burns or crush injuries, can lead to DIC. Tissue damage and release of procoagulant substances contribute to abnormal clot formation.
6. Liver Disease: Advanced liver disease, such as liver failure or [[cirrhosis]], disrupts the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. Reduced synthesis of clotting factors and impaired clearance of activated clotting factors can contribute to DIC.
7. Snakebites: Certain venomous snakebites can cause DIC. The venom components may directly activate the coagulation system, leading to clotting abnormalities.
8. Immunological Disorders: Conditions like autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis), or transfusion reactions can trigger DIC through immune-mediated mechanisms.
9. Heatstroke: Severe heatstroke can result in DIC due to widespread endothelial damage, activation of the clotting cascade, and consumption of clotting factors.

### Presentation
- medical emergency
- Presentation with risk factors
- Bleeding: 
	- both [[mucocutaneous bleeding]] 
	- Deep tissue bleeding due to defect in [[secondary hemostasis]] 
- Anemia
### Lab findings
- CBC: Thrombocytopenia, Anemia
- [[Hemolytic markers]] 
- Coagulation
	- Elevated PT/aPTT
	- Elevated FDP/D-dimers

### Management
- Treat underlying cause
- Supportive treatment
	- Packed RBCs
	- [[Tranexamic acid]] if high FDP, severe bleeding 
	- More bleeding: Platelets, [[FFP]]
	- More thrombosis: Heparin
