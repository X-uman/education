### Clinical features
- 
### Diagnostics (2/3)
1. Symptoms of [[Acute coronary syndrome]] 
2. ECG Changes can be ST-T changes or new [[Left bundle branch block]] 
	 - [[STEMI]] or [[STEMI-equivalents]] 
	 - [[NSTEMI]]
	 - For prior infarctions: [[Pathological Q-wave]] with or without symptoms
3. Positive [[cardiac biomarkers]] 
###### Advanced modalities
- [[Cardiac investigations]] 

### Pathophysiology


### Management
- Triage the patient based on ECG findings
- Acute Management
	- [[Oxygen therapy]] 
	- Aspirin 300 mg STAT 
	- Clopidogrel 300 mg STAT
	- Atorvastatin 80 mg STAT and repeat every 24 h
	- Pain management
		- [[Nitrates]] sublingually or
		- Morphine + Metoclopramide or Pethidine + Phenargan with caution
	- Heparin
	- [[Reperfusion therapy]] 
- Preventive management
	- Statins
	- Beta-blockers
	- Antiplatelet 
		- Low dose Aspirin: 70-100 mg/d
		- Dual antiplatelet therapy
	- Manage comorbidities
	- Other cardioprotective drugs
