###  **Overview*
  - Commonest cause of primary GN.

### Etiologies

| Causes        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Primary (75%) | - aka Heyman nephritis<br>- Autoantibodies (HLA-DQA1) formed against Podocyte PLA-2 Receptor (Megalin in rats).<br>- Results in fixed intrinsic tissue antigen deposition.                                                  |
| Secondary     | - **Drugs:** Penicillamine, Gold, Captopril, NSAIDs <br>- **Tumors:** Lung, Colon, Breast, Melanoma <br>- **Infections:** HBV, HCV, Syphilis, Malaria, Schistosoma <br>- **Autoimmune Diseases:** Thyroiditis <br>- **SLE** |

### **Pathogenesis:**
  - In-situ/circulating immune complex deposition.
  - Complement activation.
  - Activation of glomerular epithelial and mesangial cells.
  - Release of oxidants and proteases.
  - Damage to the capillary wall leading to protein leakage.
#### Pathological Findings
- **Light Microscopy (LM):**
  - Uniform diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall.
  - GBM thickened 5-10x, normal cellularity.
  - GBM spike and dome pattern in silver stain or "hair on end" appearance.
  - Later stages show segmental/global sclerosis.
- **Electron Microscopy (EM):**
  - Granular/interrupted sub-epithelial deposits.
  - Effaced foot processes.
  - Spikes represent normal BM; domes represent immune deposits.
- **Immunofluorescence (IF):**
  - Granular IgG4, C3, diffuse.

#### Clinical Features
- **Patient Demographics:**
  - Typically affects young adults.
- **Symptoms:**
  - Indolent non-selective [[proteinuria]].
  - [[Nephrotic Syndrome]] 
  - Nephritic syndrome in some patients.
- **Response to Treatment:**
  - Not responsive to corticosteroids.
  - 40% cases show auto remission.
