### Indications
- [[Thyroid ultrasonography]]  findings as following:
- Solid hypoechoic nodules ≥ 1 cm  
- Consider for solid hypoechoic nodules < 1 cm if any of the following are present: 
	- Extrathyroidal growth
	- Cervical lymphadenopathy
	- Symptoms suggestive of distant metastases
	- Patient preference for FNAC over observation
- Partly cystic nodule in 
	- Low risk pattern (eccentric solid component): FNAC if size is ≥ 1.5 cm 
	- Very low risk pattern: Consider FNAC if size is ≥ 2 cm. 
- Purely cystic nodule: diagnostic FNAC not recommended but cosmetic FNAC can be done
