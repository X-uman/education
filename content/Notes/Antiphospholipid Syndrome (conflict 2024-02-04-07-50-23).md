## definition
- [[Autoimmune diseases]] 
- Formation of procoagulatory [[antiphospholipid antibodies]] 
- Antibodies activate [[platelets]] and vascular endothelium.
- Inhibit [[Protein C]] and [[Protein S]] 
- Induction of a [[hypercoagulable state]] → ↑ risk of [[thrombosis]] and [[Arterial embolism]]

### etiology
- primary - [[HLA]] DR7 +
- secondary:
	- [[SLE]], [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
	- [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]
	 - Infections [[syphilis]], [[Hepatitis C]], [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[Tuberculosis]], [[Borreliosis]] 
	- drugs: [[procainamide]], [[phenytoin]], [[chlorpromazine]]

### Presentation and complications
- Female: [[recurrent abortion]] due to [[placental infarction]] >= 10 weeks
	- Inhibition of Trophoblastic differentiation and function
	- [[complement pathway]] activation at Feto-maternal interface resulting in Local [[Inflammation]]
	- Placental [[Thrombosis]] 
	- Other risks
		- [[Hypertensive disorder in pregnancy]]
		- [[IUGR]]
		- [[IUFD]]
		- [[Preterm labor]]
		- [[placental abruption]]
		- [[HELLP Syndrome]] 

- Male: [[arterial thrombosis]]
- Female: [[venous thrombosis]] and [[Arterial embolism]]
- [[microvascular thrombosis]]: [[Microangiopathic hemolysis]] 
- [[livedo reticularis]] 
- > 3 organs involved: catastrophic, rapid organ failure and death

### diagnosis
- Clinical: Thrombosis and Pregnancy complication
- Laboratory Assay: [[antiphospholipid antibodies]] 
- other findings:
	- [[Pancytopenia]]
	- [[Hemolysis]]
	- [[leukopenia]]

- [[Coagulation panel]]: 
	- In vitro: Increased [[Partial thromboplastin time]], non-normalized [[Mixing study]], normalized after adding fresh [[phospholipids]]

- Symptomatic patients: The presence of ≥ 1 type of aPL antibody supports the diagnosis.

- Asymptomatic patients
	- The presence of associated antibodies is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis. It is not specific to [[Antiphospholipid Syndrome]] and can be seen in [[SLE]]
	- Persistent positivity is associated with a higher risk of thrombotic and obstetric complications. may need [[Anticoagulants]] 

## Management
- [[Anticoagulants]]
	- Avoid [[Warfarin]] in [[Pregnancy]]
	- replace with Prophylactic LMW [[Unfractionated heparin]] + aspirin
- [[NSAIDs]] and lifelong? [[Aspirin]] to prevent [[Platelets activation]]
- [[Glucocorticoids]] to limit immune response
- [[Immunosuppressant drugs]] if severe disease
	- [[Hydroxychloroquine]] in women with [[SLE]] in pregnancy
