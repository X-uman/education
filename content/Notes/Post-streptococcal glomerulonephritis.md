### Overview
- **Also Known As:** Acute Diffuse Proliferative GN
### **Pathogenesis:**
  - Caused by Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes (Nephritogenic Strains: 12, 4, 1).
  - Leads to M-Proteins production, resulting in antibody formation.
  - In-situ immune complex formation, complement activation, and subsequent damage.

### Pathological Findings
- **Light Microscopy (LM):** Acute diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis
	- Diffuse, global hypercellularity with neutrophilic and monocytic infiltration.
	- Mesangial proliferation.
	- Normal glomerular basement membrane (GBM).
	- Swollen glomeruli with obliterated lumens.  
	- Interstitial edema and tubules containing red blood cell casts.
- **Electron Microscopy (EM):**
  - Sub-epithelial discrete, amorphous deposits (lumpy-bumpy deposits/humps).
- **Immunofluorescence (IF):**
  - Granular deposits of IgG, C3, and sometimes IgM in mesangium and GBM, giving a lumpy-bumpy appearance.

### Clinical Features
- **Children (6-10 years old)
	- 1-4 weeks after recovery from sore throat or skin infection.
	- Acute onset of malaise, fever, nausea, oliguria, and hematuria (smoky or coca-colored urine) 
	-   Approximately 95% recover with sodium and water therapy.
	  - Severe oliguria may progress to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), chronic glomerulonephritis, or prolonged proteinuria.
- **Adults**
  - Sudden hypertension or edema may occur.
