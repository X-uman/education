AKI of Exclusion in presence of Cirrhosis  

### Pathophysiology
- [[hypovolemia]] but no shock
- Splanchnic vasodilation 
- Reduced [[Renal perfusion]] 

### Diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI
- Presence of cirrhosis with ==ascites==
- Diagnosis of [[AKI.canvas|AKI]] according to the following criteria:
   - An increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within a 7-day period (Use baseline since 3 months)
    - And/or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg for ≥ 6 hours
- No improvement after two consecutive days of albumin infusions and diuretic withdrawal
- Absence of shock
- No current or recent nephrotoxic agents
- Absence of signs of structural kidney disease

low FENa < 0.2% as a diagnostic criterion but others do not

### Types
- HRS-AKI
- HRS-NAKI

### Management
- Pharmacotherapy: Can cause [[ischemia]] 
	- Preferred: Vasoconstrictor (Terlipressin or Norepinephrine) + Albumin
	- Alternative: Midodrine + Octeotride
	- IV [[Fluids]] with caution 
- Interventional
	- [[Renal replacement therapy]]
	- [[Liver transplantation]]
	- [[TIPSS]] not routinely recommended 
- Avoid [[Large volume paracentesis]] without albumin
