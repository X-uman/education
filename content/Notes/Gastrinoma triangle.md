The gastrinoma triangle, also known as the "triangle of doom," is an anatomical region in the abdomen where the majority of gastrinomas are located. The boundaries of the gastrinoma triangle are:
1. **Superiorly:** The junction of the cystic duct and common bile duct.
2. **Inferiorly:** The junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum.
3. **Laterally:** The junction of the neck and body of the pancreas.

| Location           | Percentage of Cases       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Duodenum           | ~70%                      |
| Pancreas           | ~25% (typically the head) |
| Ectopic locations  | 5-15%                     |
- Ectopic .ocations include liver, peripancreatic lymph nodes, ovaries.
