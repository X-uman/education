### Pathogenesis
- an increased number of defective, circulating IgA antibodies are synthesized (often triggered by mucosal infections, i.e., upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections) → IgAantibodies form immune complexes that deposit in the kidney → glomerulonephritis (type III hypersensitivity reaction)
### Clinical features
**IgA nephropathy is limited to the kidneys and typically affects adults in contrast to IgA vasculitis aka Henoch--Scholein Purpura which affects children and involves joints, skin, brain, git, heart everywhere.** 
- Males > Children
- Peak age: second to third decades of life
- Recurring episodes of: 
	- Gross or microscopic hematuria: Nephritic Syndrome
	- Flank pain
	- Low-grade fever
	- And/or nephritic syndrome (including hypertension)
- Usually during or immediately following a respiratory or gastrointestinal or Urinary tract infection (Synpharyngitic GN)
- Can progress to [[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis]] and/or nephrotic syndrome
- Up to 50% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease within 20–25 years.
- Associated with [[Celiac sprue]] 
### Diagnostics
- IgA levels increased in blood
- C3 levels are decreased due to consumption of [[complement pathway]] 
- Biopsy: 
	- IgA and C3 deposition in mesangium
	- Electron microscopy: Mesangial immune complex deposition
