- Metabolic acidosis despite normal looking hemodynamic and renal signs, it is seen in compensated [[shock]] where there is reduced perfusion to non-vital organs to maintain adequate perfusion to Brain, Lungs, Kidneys. 
- If it is prolonged it will lead to [[Reperfusion injury]] and cause multiple organ failure and death by flushing the chemical and humoral products of hypoxia. 
- More than 12 hrs is significant higher rate of death.
