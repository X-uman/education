#### Anatomical/Mechanical Obstruction
- Causes of [[Bladder Outlet Obstruction]] 
### Based on Physiology of Propulsion
Loss of peristalsis/Propulsion
- [[Neurogenic bladder]]
- Smooth muscle dysfunction associated with ageing
- [[Drugs causing Urinary Retention]]
- Anal Pain [[Submucosal hemorrhoidectomy]] 
- Intensive Postoperative Analgesic management
- [[Spinal Anesthesia]] 
- [[Spinal Shock]] following Spinal Cord injury


## Clinical Features

### Incidence
- 
### Symptoms
###### Local 
- Downstream: No passage of Urine
- Upstream: Distension, Pain, tenderness, dull to percussion
	- Chronic retention: No Pain, but [[Hydroureteronephrosis]] 
###### Systemic 
- Possible Signs of concurrent [[Urinary Tract Infection]] 
- Possible [[Focal neurological deficits]] 
### Signs
###### Local
- Inspection: Distended bladder at Suprapubic level
- Palpation: Tenderness
- Percussion: Dull

###### Systemic
- CNS examination: FNDs

## Complications

#### Local
- [[Overflow Incontinence]] in neurogenic causes
- Damage to detrusor
- Infection 
- [[Acute Kidney Injury]]

#### General
- 

## Diagnosis
#### Imaging
- Chronic Retention: Increased Residual volume of urine 
#### Physiological
- Chronic Retention: high pressures during bladder filling
- 

## Management
#### Symptomatic
- [[Urethral Catheterization]]
	- Record the volume of urine drained
	- [[Abdomial Examination]] to Rule out other pathology
- Suprapubic puncture: 
	- Cystofix or Lawrence Add-a-Cath
	- Plastic Suprapubic trocar and cannula with Foley Catheter
#### Definitive
- Urethral Stricture: [[Optical Urethrotomy]] 

#### Complications
- Post-operative diuresis after catheterization in chronic retention
- [[Hematuria]]
