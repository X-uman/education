 - HR/SBP (>0.9 indicates decompensated shock) 
 - The shock index has a limited role in emergency care since it is very nonspecific. This is especially the case for children, as they have a better ability to compensate for blood loss. The appearance of a circulatory response in this age group occurs quite late and is, therefore, less reliable as a clinical sign of shock when compared with adults.
