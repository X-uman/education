### types 
- [[Primary Osteoporosis]]
- [[Secondary osteoporosis]] 
### Clinical features 
- Asymptomatic until [[Pathological fractures]] develop
- Vertebral Fractures may be asymptomatically present which changes management 
### Diagnostics
- Assessment of [[Bone Mineral density]] 
- Calculation of risk factors for falls using [[CDC STEADI algorithm]] 
- [[Fracture Risk Assessment]] 
- Once Osteoporosis confirmed, rule out [[Secondary osteoporosis]] 
### Management
- [[Bone health optimization]]
- [[Fall prevention strategies]] 
- Pharmacotherapy from Risk assessment for fractures 
	- [[Bisphosphonates]] are first line, but if contraindicated
	- [[Denosumab]] for [[CKD]] 
	- [[Parathyroid hormone]] and [[PTrP]] Analogues
	- [[Raloxifene]]
	- [[Calcitonin]]
	- [[HRT]] 
		- Estrogen + Progesterone (Always except Hysterectomy)
		- [[Testosterone]] 

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Osteomalacia]]
- [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
- [[bone metastases]]
- [[Multiple myeloma]]
- [[Intraosseous hemangioma]] 

### Complications
- [[Pathological fractures]]
- [[Osteonecrosis of Femoral head]]
- Muscle atrophy/weakness
