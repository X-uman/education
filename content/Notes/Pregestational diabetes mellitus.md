### Management
- stringent glycemic control (exercise, diet, insulin therapy)
- Delivery and postpartum
	- Consider early delivery if the patient has poor glycemic control or preeclampsia
	- Consider C-section if estimated fetus weight > 4500 g
	- Intrapartum IV insulin and dextrose to avoid blood glucose fluctuations (maintain blood glucose level between 80â€“100 mg/dL; hourly blood glucose measurements
