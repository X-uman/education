### Definition
- BG < 40 mg/dl or plasma glucose < 45 mg/dl in a neonate
### Risk factors
- [[Small for gestational age]] and [[IUGR]] 
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]] 
- [[Postmaturity]]
- [[Gestational diabetes mellitus]]
- [[Neonatal hypothermia]]

### Presentation
- Jitteriness and tremors
- [[Neonatal seizures]]
- [[Neonatal apnea]]
- Sweating, inability to feed

### Diagnostics
- Glucose levels should be obtained for symptomatic infants and/or those with known risk factors. 
    - Asymptomatic infants: blood sugar levels < 45 mg/dL within 24â€“48 hours or < 50mg/dL thereafter
    - Symptomatic infants: blood sugar levels < 40 mg/dL within the first 48 hours or < 50mg/dL thereafter


### Management
- Measure blood glucose concentration at frequent intervals
- For asymptomatic patients
	- If BG < 20 mg/dl
		- continuous infusion as symptomatic
	- BG 20-40: offer a feed and recheck glucose after 30min to 1 h, if not normalized, go for continuous IV infusion
- For symptomatic patients
	- IV 10% Dextrose at 2 ml/kg bolus and
	- continuous infusion of IV fluids and glucose infusion rate at 6 mg/kg/min and monitor blood glucose
- Despite IV glucose, patients may develop [[Persistent hypoglycemia during infancy]]
