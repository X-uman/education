	- Depends upon maturation and myelination of nervous system

	- [[Primitive (infant) reflexes]] have to be lost before relevant milestones are attained
- Response change from generalized responses to discrete voluntary action under cortical control
- Development in one field may not necessarily be parallel in other field termed 'developmental dissociation'.
