- Excess [[Parathyroid hormone]] 

| Causes    | Etiologies                                                                                                                                                                | Clinical features                                                                                | Biochemical                                                                                              | Treatment                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary   | [[Parathyroid adenoma]], [[Parathyroid carcinoma]]                                                                                                                        | Often asymptomatic                                                                               | High PTH, **[[hypercalcemia]],** Low phosphate                                                           | Surgery                                                                 |
| Secondary | Chronic [[Hypocalcemia]] and/or [[Hyperphosphatemia]] stimulates PTH secretion, <br>commonest cause is [[CKD]], [[Vitamin D deficiency]], [[Malabsorption syndrome]] etc. | Features of PTH excess are seen, with **[[hypocalcemia]]**, features of [[Renal Osteodystrophy]] | High PTH, low or normal Calcium levels, but phosphate levels are high in CKD, and normal in other causes | Treat underlying cause of [[Hypocalcemia]] mainly medically (see below) |
| Tertiary  | Long-term secondary hyperparathyroidism, even after Calcium returns up to normal, persistent PTH secretion                                                                |                                                                                                  | Very high PTH, Ca, phosphate also high                                                                   | Surgery                                                                 |
### Other diagnostics modalities
- [[Alkaline phosphatase]]: marker of bone remodelling is high in all cases of [[Hyperparathyroidism]] 
### Clinical features seen in hyperparathyroidism
- [[hypercalcemia]]
- Excess bone breakdown 
	- Cystic hemorrhagic regions in bone: [[Osteitis fibrosa cystica]] or Brown tumors, seen primarily in primary hyperparathyroidism but also in secondary 
	- [[Osteomalacia]]
	- Adynamic bone (no further bone mineralization)
### Diagnostics
| Diagnostic Confirmation: both results must be present on two separate occasions, ≥ 2 weeks apart |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ↑ Serum calcium                                                                                  |
| ↑ Serum intact PTH (or inappropriately normal)                                                   |
| **Additional Studies: for patients with confirmed pHPT**                                         |
| Serum creatinine and estimated GFR: to evaluate for renal dysfunction                            |
| 25-hydroxyvitamin D: to assess for deficiency                                                    |
| Phosphate: may be low                                                                            |
| ALP: high as a result of bone turnover                                                           |
| 24-hour urinary calcium and creatinine                                                           |

| 24-hour Urinary Calcium and Creatinine                                                                                |                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ↑ Ca/Cr clearance ratio (> 0.02): suggests pHPT and is a risk factor for [[nephrocalcinosis]] and [[nephrolithiasis]] | A normal PTH level does not exclude pHPT. PTH should be low in patients with hypercalcemia |
| ↓ Ca/Cr clearance ratio (< 0.01): suggests [[familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia]], which can mimic pHPT             |                                                                                            |

### Management 
- Surgical
	- Parathyroidectomy (complication is [[Hungry bone syndrome]])
- Medical management of [[hypercalcemia]] 
	- [[Bisphosphonates]]
	- [[Calcimimites]]
- If hyperparathyroidism is due to [[Hypocalcemia]]
	- [[Vitamin D]] 
	- Calcium supplementation
- Treatment of [[Hyperphosphatemia]]
