| Culture                  | Blood cultures positive within the first week of symptoms; urine cultures positive after the first week.<br>Special media (Fletcher medium) required; takes weeks to grow.                                                  |
| Complete Blood Count     | - Leukocytosis, usually neutrophilic<br>- Thrombocytopenia and anemia may be observed in Weil disease                                                                                                                       |
| [[Renal Function Tests]] | Elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), especially in Weil disease                                                                                                                                                              |
| Liver Function Tests     | Elevated levels of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)                                                                                                                                      |

### Management
- Antibiotic treatment may induce a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
