### Introduction


---
### Etiology
- [[Echinococcus spp.]] 
- Feco-oral route of transmission 
- Hosts 
	- Definitive hosts: foxes, dogs, and cats
	- Intermediate hosts: hoofed animals (e.g., sheep, goats, camels, horses, cattle, and pigs)
	- Humans are accidental hosts (e.g., sheep farmers)
-

### Pathogenesis
- Fate of hydatid cyst 
	- Spontaneous resolution
	- Calcification
	- Spontaneous evacuation following inflammatory reaction
	- Rupture into body cavity leading to disseminated growth 
---
### Presentation
- Most patients are asymptomatic
- MC presentation: Palpable intraabdominal mass i.e. [[Hepatomegaly]] 
- Abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia

---
### Diagnostics
- [[Casoni test]] 
- [[Serological tests]] for Echinococcus 
- CBC: [[Eosinophilia]] (parasitic infestation)
- Imaging: 
	- Rosette appearance 
	- CT: Ring like calcification
	- [[Gharbi's and WHO classifications]] 
- Aspiration: [[Hydatid sand]] 
- Direct visualization: [[Hydatid cyst]] 

---
### Management
- Perioperative drugs
	- DOC: Albendazole/Mebendazole: Scolicidal, shrinks size of cyst
- Surgeries: [[Treatment of cyst]] 
	- Most preferred for surgically appropriate lesions: [[PAIR]] 
	- Cyst evacuation with Omentopexy
	- Cyst evacuation with capitonnage or introflexion
	- Pericystectomy with omentoplasty: most effective treatment
	- Hepatic resection

### Complications
- Intrabiliary rupture

---
- [[Hydatid cyst]]
