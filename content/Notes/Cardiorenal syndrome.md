### Introduction
- Systolic dysfunction → ↓ cardiac output → renal hypoperfusion → prerenal kidney failure
- Diastolic dysfunction → systemic venous congestion → renal venous congestion → ↓ trans-glomerular pressure gradient → ↓ GFR → ↓ kidney function
- RAAS activation → salt and fluid retention → hypertension → [[Hypertensive nephropathy]]

### Types
Here's the information presented in a tabulated format:

| Type                                                     | Description                                            | Example                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type 1: Acute Cardiorenal Syndrome (most common subtype) | Heart failure leading to [[AKI.canvas\|AKI]]           | Acute coronary syndrome and/or acute heart failure resulting in acute kidney injury          |
| Type 2: Chronic Cardiorenal Syndrome                     | Chronic heart failure leading to [[CKD]]               | Chronic heart failure resulting in the new onset or progression of chronic kidney disease    |
| Type 3: Acute Renocardiac Syndrome                       | [[AKI.canvas\|AKI]] leading to [[acute heart failure]] | Heart failure resulting from acute kidney injury due to [[Fluid overload]]                   |
| Type 4: Chronic Renocardiac Syndrome                     | [[CKD]] leading to chronic heart failure               | Left ventricular hypertrophy resulting from chronic kidney disease-associated cardiomyopathy |
| Type 5: Secondary Cardiorenal Syndrome                   | Systemic disease leading to kidney and heart failure   | [[Cirrhosis]], [[amyloidosis]]                                                               |
- **Diagnostics**: ↓ GFR, ↑ creatinine that cannot be explained by underlying kidney disease
- **Treatment**: heart failure and renal failure management (see “Acute renal injury”)
- **Prognosis**: CHF with reduced GFR and high creatinine levels (> 3 mg/dL) is associated with a poor prognosis.
