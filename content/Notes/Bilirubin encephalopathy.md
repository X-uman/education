### Pathophysiology
- Only high levels of lipid-soluble, unconjugated bilirubin (> 20 mg/dL) can cause kernicterus. Conjugated bilirubin is hydrophilic and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. 
- [[Basal nuclei]] are the most commonly involved, kernicterus means postmortem finding of yellow discoloration
- Extrapyramidal [[Cerebral palsy]] is the commonest complication

### Acute encephalopathy
-  Early:
	- [[Infantile hypotonia (Floppy baby syndrome)]] 
	- Poor feeding
	- loss of Moro's reflex
	- Fever
	- irritability
	- seizures
- Advanced diseases
	- [[Hypertonia]] and Opisthotonus
	- Coma and even death

### Chronic encephalopathy/Kernicterus (@sad mum)
- [[Sensorineural hearing loss]] 
- [[Athetosis]]
- [[Dental dysplasia]]
- [[intellectual disability]]
- Upward gaze limitation
