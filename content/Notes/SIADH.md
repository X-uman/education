| - [[Small cell carcinoma]] of Lung                | Ectopic secretion of ADH by tumor cells, leading to excessive water absorption and hyponatremia.                                                                                                   |
| **Drugs**                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| - Medications that increase ADH secretion         | Certain drugs can cause SIADH by increasing the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and hyponatremia. Examples include carbamazepine, SSRIs, and cyclophosphamide. |
| **Other Causes**                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| - CNS disorders                                   | Central nervous system disorders can disrupt the normal regulation of ADH secretion, leading to SIADH.                                                                                             |
| - Pulmonary disease                               | Certain pulmonary conditions can also trigger the inappropriate release of ADH, contributing to the development of SIADH.                                                                          |
| - Infections, trauma                              | Various infectious and traumatic conditions may also result in SIADH, although the mechanism is not fully understood.                                                                              |
| **Clinical Features**                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| - [[Hyponatremia]]                                | Characterized by low serum sodium levels, leading to neurological dysfunction and cerebral edema.                                                                                                  |
| - Cerebral Edema                                  | Swelling of the brain tissue due to the influx of water, resulting in altered mental status and potential seizures.                                                                                |
| - Total Body Water Increased, Blood Volume Normal | Despite increased total body water, blood volume remains normal, and peripheral edema is not typically observed.                                                                                   |

| - [[Central Pontine Myelinolysis]]                | A severe neurological condition that can occur if hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, leading to demyelination of nerve cells in the brainstem.                                                 |
