- Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of phospholipids and proteins produced by lamellar bodies of type II alveolar cells. These [[phospholipids]] reduce alveolar [[surface tension]], preventing the alveoli from collapsing.
- Most important component Saturated phosphatidyl choline: **dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline** s
	- Phosphatidyl glycerol
	- Cholesterol
	- Surfactant proteins: A, **B**, C, D
- Surfactant deficiency is most likely to occur in preterm infants, because:
   - Surfactant production begins at approximately 20 weeks gestation.
   - Distribution throughout the lungs begins at 28-32 weeks' gestation and does not reach sufficient concentration until 35 weeks gestation.
- [[surface tension]]
