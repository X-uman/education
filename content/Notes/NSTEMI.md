### ECG changes
- No ST elevations present
- Nonspecific signs of ischemia may be present, including:
	- ST depression, especially if horizontal or downsloping
	- Transient ST deviations ≥ 0.5 mm (≥ 0.05 mV) in symptomatic patients at rest
	- T-wave inversions of ≥ 2 mm (≥ 0.2 mV) in V1–V6
- Additional considerations
	- Normal ECG may be seen in up to 15% of patients with NSTEMI.
	- Be wary of STEMI-equivalent ECG findings (e.g., signs of posterior myocardial infarction) and repeat ECGs if inconclusive.
### Diagnostics
- For patients without ST elevations on ECG, determine the likelihood of NSTE-ACS using serial ECGs and troponin levels. 
- Follow local rapid diagnostic protocols if available and tailor workup and management to individual risk stratification for ACS.

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistent dynamic ECG changes | NSTEMI/Unstable angina | Start management                                     |
| Non-dynamic ECG changes        | Unknown                | Check troponin or high-sensitivity troponin (hscTn). |
| Troponin > 99th % centile      |                        |                                                      |
| Δtroponin                      |                        |                                                      |
### Management based on cardiac biomarkers

| Scenario                                                                                                                             | Action                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First troponin is detectable AND Δtrop is significant                                                                                | Start management for NSTEMI                                               |
| First troponin is above the upper limit of normal (ULN) AND clinical suspicion is significant                                        | Consider starting empiric management of NSTEMI before the second troponin |
| First high-sensitivity cardiac [[troponin]] (hscTn) value is undetectable ≥ 3 hours from symptom onset AND clinical suspicion is low | Consider ruling out NSTEMI                                                |
### Risk stratification
- [[GRACE score]] 
- [[HEART score]] 
- [[TIMI risk score for NSTEMI]] 

### Management
- Dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation is indicated initially and the preferred regimens vary based on patient risk factors and timing of revascularization.
- [[Risk dependent NSTEMI management]] 
- [[Thrombolysis]] is not indicated in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI.
