- Reduces [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
- Reduces [[R-L Shunt]]
-  Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is the mainstay treatment for PPHN because of its ability to potently vasodilate the pulmonary vasculature (reducing V/Q mismatch) without decreasing systemic vascular resistance. 
- NO induces smooth muscle relaxation (and subsequent vasodilation) by activating guanylyl cyclase, which increases cGMP synthesis. 
- A side effect of inhaled NO is the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) at high levels, resulting in the formation of methemoglobin. 
- Because Fe3+ has a reduced affinity for oxygen binding, methemoglobin is a poor oxygen transporter. 
- Therefore, [[methemoglobinemia]] results in poor tissue oxygenation and causes clinical signs of [[cyanosis]]. 
- Other side effects of inhaled NO in neonates include [[platelet dysfunction]], [[pulmonary edema]], and the formation of peroxy nitrites.
