## What is it?
- A fever of > 41.5°C (> 106.7°F) is called hyperpyrexia. This extraordinarily high fever can develop in patients with severe infections but most commonly occurs in patients with central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages.

## Management
- In hyperpyrexia, the use of cooling blankets facilitates the reduc- tion of temperature; however, cooling blankets should not be used without oral antipyretics. In hyperpyretic patients with CNS disease or trauma (CNS bleeding), reducing core temperature mitigates the detrimental effects of high temperature on the brain.
