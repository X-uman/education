- [[Coagulation system.canvas|Coagulation system]] 
- cardiac [[stasis]], thrombosis with abnormal cardiac valves ([[artificial cardiac valves]], [[Mitral Stenosis]]) : not direct ones, they are weaker anticoagulants due to single site of action

- [[venous thrombosis]]: all can be given

Synthesis: [[Warfarin]] for [[venous thrombosis]] 
Indirect: [[Unfractionated heparin]] for both cases

### Direct oral anticoagulants
- [[venous thrombosis]], [[nonvalvular atrial fibrillation]] (Rx + Prevention), do not required monitoring
- [[Factor Xa inhibitors]] : -xaban
- [[Direct thrombin inhibitors]]: -tran 
- [[Fibrinogen]] blockers are: [[Antiplatelet agents]], [[Glycoprotein 2b-3a]] inhibitors are -fiban
- [[Citrate]]: Sequestration of [[Calcium]] ions, for [[Dialysis]] 
- [[PCC]] is for life threatening [[hemorrhage]] 

[[Acetaminophen]] metabolite inhibits Vitamin K from helping Carboxylase enzyme: Warfarin like effect
