### Definition
- Definition: BP > 180/120 mmHg with evidence of end organ damage 
- [[Malignant hypertension]]: [[Fibrinoid Necrosis]] 
- initial goal of therapy is to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by no more than 25% within minutes to 2 h or to a blood pressure in the range of 160/100â€“110 mmHg
### Management
- ABCDE Management
- Transfer patient to ICU
- Continuous Monitoring
	- Blood pressure (consider invasive if required)
	- [[EKG]] 
	- Metabolic profile every 6 h
- Institution of IV anti-hypertensives
- Investigate if following comorbidities are suspected
- Treat any contributing comorbidities

- The response to and duration of action of IV [[hydralazine]] can be unpredictable. It should, therefore, be used with caution.
- Because prolonged use of [[sodium nitroprusside]] carries a risk of cyanide toxicity, it should be limited in dose and duration of use.
### Considerations
- Mean arterial pressure should not be lowered by more than 25% within the first hour, except in special cases. Reducing the blood pressure too rapidly can lead to hypoperfusion and ischemia in certain organs (e.g., brain, kidney, heart).
- Then lower it to < 160/100 in next 2-6 h
- then to baseline over next 2 days
- Switch to PO after 8-24 h of BP control at target
