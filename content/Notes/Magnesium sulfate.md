### Mechanism
- Anti-calcium activity
	- Presynaptic: 
		- Inhibits [[Glutamate]]  release: Brain
		- Inhibits [[Acetylcholine]] release: Muscles (Tocolytics)
	- Post-synaptic
		- Inhibits NMDA receptor: Brain
		- Inhibits Ca-influx into cells: Brain, muscles or Limbs, Heart, Uterus 
		- Potentiates Adenosine Action 

### Effects
- Anticonvulsant
- Neuroprotective both mother and Very low birth weight fetus against development of [[Cerebral palsy]] 
- [[tocolytics]] 
- Antihypertensive 
- [[Antiarrhythmic drugs]] 

### Adverse effects
- Due to its similar effect on Ca influx as in [[Lambert Eaton Syndrome]], it is contraindicated in [[Myasthenia gravis]] 
- Magnesium freely crosses the placenta; as a result, the cord blood concentration approximates the maternal serum concentration. 
	- Maternal therapy causes a decrease in baseline fetal heart rate, which generally remains within the normal range, and a decrease in fetal heart rate variability, which may be absent or minimal. 
	- The biophysical profile score and nonstress test reactivity are not significantly altered
- cautiously to patients with pulmonary edema, with attention to fluid restriction, diuresis, and oxygen supplementation. 
### Monitoring toxicity
- Patients with normal kidney functions are unlikely to have toxicity 

|Serum Magnesium Concentration (mEq/L)|Serum Magnesium Concentration (mg/dL)|Serum Magnesium Concentration (mmol/L)|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|7 to 10|8.5 to 12.0|3.5 to 5.0|Loss of deep tendon reflexes|
|10 to 13|12 to 16|5.0 to 6.5|Respiratory paralysis|
|>15|>18|>7.5|Altered cardiac conduction|
|>25|>30|>12.5|Cardiac arrest|

### Antidote
- [[Calcium gluconate]]
- Add Furosemide to accelerate excretion

| Antidote          | Dosage                                          | Route                           | Indications                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Calcium Gluconate | 15 to 30 mL of a 10% solution (1500 to 3000 mg) | Intravenous Over 2 to 5 minutes | For cardiac arrest or with severe cardiac toxicity related to hypermagnesemia                                          |
| Calcium Gluconate | 10 mL of a 10% solution                         | Intravenous                     | For less severe cases, but life-threatening cardiorespiratory compromise                                               |
| Calcium Chloride  | 5 to 10 mL of a 10% solution                    | Intravenous Over 2 to 5 minutes | acceptable alternative, but is more irritating and more likely to cause tissue necrosis in the event of extravasation. |
