- Mostly arise from single cell-type, in 30-60 yo
- Common typese
	- [[Prolactinoma]](commonest)
	- [[Somatotroph cell Adenoma]]
	- [[Corticotroph cell adenoma]] 
- Uncommon--TSH, FSH, LH, plurihormonal
- Types--Functional and Non-functional

### Risk factors
- Sporadic mainly, 5% inherited defect of MEN1, CDKN1B, PRKAR1A, AIP
- 40% of Somatotroph Cell Adenoma--G-Protein Mutation---> Loss of GTPase activity of Gs-alpha(GNAS Mutation)---> Excessive cAMP--> Unchecked cellular Proliferation
- Aggressive behavior if CDK1, TP53, RB, HRAS Mutations--Pituitary Ca

### Pathology
##### Gross findings
- Types
	- Microadenoma are <1cm
	- Macroadenoma are >1cm
- Usually solitary discrete, soft mass in Sella, sometimes erode the Sella and Ant. Clinoid Processes
- Large mass--grows superiorly--> compress O
##### Microscopic findings
- Monomorphous uniform cells, less stroma(Hence soft, gelatinous grossly)
- Arranged in sheets, cords and nests
- Nuclear atypia may be seen,
- Cells may be acidophilic/basophilic/chromophobic
- Cells may contain secretory granules
### Presentation
- Small size: single hormone production if functional
- Large: [[Space Occupying Lesion]]
	- [[Optic nerve compression]]
	- Cavernous sinus
	- Sphenoid sinus
	- Dura mater
- Acute hemorrhage into adenoma: [[Pituitary apoplexy]]

### Diagnostics
- Hormone levels
- MRI
