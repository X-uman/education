| System      | Causes                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cardiac     | - [[Cyanotic Heart defects]]<br>- [[Subacute infective endocarditis]]                                                                                                                                                 |
| Respiratory | - [[cystic fibrosis]]<br>- [[lung cancers]]<br>- [[Bronchiectasis]]<br>- [[Lung abscess]]<br>- [[Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] <br>- Benign [[Mesothelioma]] <br>- [[Asbestosis]] <br>- No clubbing in COPD, Asthma |
| Digestive   | - [[Primary biliary cirrhosis]]<br>- [[IBD]] <br>- [[Celiac diseases]] <br>- [[Gastric Carcinoma]] <br>- [[Amoebic liver abscess]]                                                                                    |
| Endocrine   | - [[Thyroid acropachy]] <br>	- [[Thyrotoxicosis]]<br>	- [[Grave's disease]] <br>- [[Myxedema]]<br>- [[Hyperparathyroidism]]                                                                                           |
### Types
- Symmetrical clubbing: Mentioned above
- Assymmetrical 
	- Unilateral
		- [[shoulder instability (TUBS and AMBRI)]]
		- [[Pancoast tumor]] 
	- Unidigital: [[Sarcoidosis]], Trauma 
	- Toes without fingers
### Pathogenesis
- Megakaryocyte-Platelet theory which are normally filtered by normal lungs
	- in lung diseases, they bypass and get impacted in nail capillaries and release VEGF and PDGF 
	- In [[R-L Shunt]], they go into systemic circulation 
- Arterial Hypoxemia and VEGF
- Humoral theory
	- Increased levels of unoxidized ferritin escaping oxidative degradation in lungs by shunt bypass
	- Others: [[Bradykinin]], Estrogen, GH
- In subacute infective endocarditis, platelet clumps are released into circulation and get impacted in the nail-bed 
- Neurogenic theory from vagus nerve

### Stages
- Stage 1: Nail Bed Fluctuation
- Stage 2: Obliteration of Lovibond angle >180 degree and positive Schamroth sign
- Grade 3: Parrot-beak appearance or drum stick appearance
- Stage 4: [[Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy]] 

### Examination of clubbing
- Nail bed fluctuation
- Schamroth window test
