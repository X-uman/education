### Pathogenesis
- Vaginal mucosa: thickened, dry and keratinized
- Decubitus ulcer
- Cervix
	- Vaginal part: Congestion leads to hyperplasia, and infection
	- Supra-vaginal part: elongation
- Urinary
	- Bladder: [[Bladder Outlet Obstruction]]
	- Ureters: [[Hydroureteronephrosis]]
	- Kidney: [[Pyelonephritis]]
- Incarceration of prolapsed tissue
- Peritonitis: infection through vaginal wall 
### Diagnostics
Here's the information organized into a table:

| Stage | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | No prolapse observed.                                                                                              |
| 1     | The most distal portion of prolapse is more than 1 cm above the level of the hymen.                                |
| 2     | The most distal portion of prolapse is 1 cm or less proximal or distal to the hymenal plane.                       |
| 3     | The most distal portion of prolapse is more than 1 cm from the hymenal plane but without complete vaginal eversion |
| 4     | The vagina is completely everted or uterine procidentia has occurred.                                              |

### Management

| Patient group | Treatment                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| All           | Address risk factors                  |
| Asymptomatic  | Consider Pelvic floor muscle exercise |
| Symptomatic   | Conservative or surgical              |
##### Conservative
- [[Vaginal pessary]]
- Pelvic floor muscle training
- Vaginal Estrogen cream

##### Surgical management
Here's the information organized into a table:

| Surgical Procedure                                              | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Obliterative Surgery                                            | Colpocleisis: Sewing the walls of the vagina together to provide support for pelvic organs.                          |
| Reconstructive Surgery (Abdominal or Vaginal Approach)          | Restoring the original position of the descended pelvic organs through surgical intervention.                        |
| Sacrocolpopexy (with Vaginal Vault Suspension and Hysterectomy) | Repair of apical or vaginal vault prolapse by performing hysterectomy and fixing the vaginal apex to the sacrum.     |
| Suspension Techniques                                           | Fixation or suspension of the prolapsed organ using native tissues such as endopelvic fascia, muscles, or ligaments. |
| Colporrhaphy                                                    | Reinforcement of the anterior or posterior vaginal wall for the repair of cystocele or rectocele.                    |
| Sacrohysteropexy                                                | Fixation of the cervix to the sacrum for the repair of uterine prolapse.                                             |
