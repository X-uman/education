- Similar to [[Chronic liver disease]], presents late, but painful 

### Definition
- Chronic inflammation with fibrosis 
- Analogous to [[cirrhosis]] 
	- Loss of pancreatic architecture: check by imaging (gold standard)
	- Leads to [[pancreatic insufficiency]]: check physiologically using [[Pancreatic function tests]] (supportive)

### Risk factors
- Chronic heavy alcohol use (most common, esp. men)
- Pancreatic ductal obstruction: strictures (e.g., due to trauma, stones)
- Tobacco use
- Idiopathic pancreatitis
- [[Hereditary pancreatitis]] 
- [[Autoimmune pancreatitis]]
- Systemic disease
    - Cystic fibrosis: âˆ¼ 2% of cystic fibrosis patients develop chronic pancreatitis. 
- Severe hypertriglyceridemia (levels > 1,000 mg/dL)
- Primary hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia) Tropical pancreatitis
    - Most common cause in the tropics (esp. southern India)
    - Young age at onset 

- *The TIGAR-O system categorizes etiologies of chronic pancreatitis: Toxic-Metabolic, Idiopathic, Genetic, Autoimmune, Recurrent acute/severe pancreatitis, and Obstructive.* 

### Pathogenesis 
- Pancreatic autodigestion 
- Stellate cell activation: [[fibrosis]]
- Loss of [[Histology of pancreas]] architecture
	- Ducts: Dilation, strictures, stones
	- Acini: [[pancreatic insufficiency]] of exocrine part
	- islets loss: Diabetes i.e. endocrine insufficiency 

### Presentation
- Similar as acute, but less severe
- Painful condition: Recurrent, progressive episodes 
- [[Diabetes Mellitus]] 
- [[Malabsorption syndrome]]

### Investigations
- CECT scan: Late findings : [[Radiological markers of inflammation]] 
- To diagnose early
	- ERCP: Chain of lakes appearance (Cambridge criteria)
	- [[Endoscopic ultrasound]]: Gold standard: [[Rosemont criteria]]
- [[MRCP]] 
**Other tests**
- [[Notes/Inflammatory markers|Inflammatory markers]] 
- [[Pancreatic function tests]] not required for diagnosis, only supportive 
- Pancreatic biopsy
- Test for risk factors
	- Genetic testing
### Management
- [[Pain management]]
- Surgical drainage for strictures and stones [[pancreatic surgeries]] 
	- Pure drainage
	- Resection
	- Hybrid: Frey's procedure
- Manage [[Diabetes Mellitus]] 
- [[Pancreatic replacement therapy]]: Take with food/ after PPI 

### Complications
- [[Chronic pain]]
- [[pancreatic insufficiency]] 
- [[pseudocyst of pancreas]] 
- [[splenic vein thrombosis]] 
- [[Pancreatic abscess]] 
- [[Portal vein thrombosis]] 
- [[Pancreatic carcinoma]]
