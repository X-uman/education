### Principles
1. Wound excision to leave only healthy bleeding skin edges
2. Wound debridement
3. Wound cleaning
4. Leave cut nerves and tendons alone
5. Wound closure
	1. Small contaminated: Can be sutured without tension
	2. Type II Open fractures: [[Delayed primary closure]]
	3. Large contaminated surface: Debridement and Skin flap or graft used, ideally within 72 h
### For non-healing wounds
- [[Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy]]
- [[Negative pressure wound therapy]] 
- Local application of PDGF

### For burn wounds

| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topical Moisturizers for Sunburns (1st degree) | - Contain aloe vera or calamine<br>- Oral NSAIDS can be given for pain<br>- Spare the dermis, retaining fluid and barring microbial entry<br>- No need for antimicrobial prophylaxis, fluid support, or debridement<br>- Lignocaine can irritate skin, so avoided in sunburns    |
| Exposure Treatment                             | Wash and dry exposed areas, such as scalp and face burns, superficial, superficial partial-thickness burns                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Topical Ointments                              | - 1% silver sulfadiazine: Cannot penetrate deeper<br> - 0.5% silver nitrate: May cause black pigmentation<br> - 5% mafenide: Deep penetration but painful, may cause metabolic acidosis<br> - Cerium bromide, nitrate: Immunomodulatory, preferred in elderly, sterilizes eschar |
| Use of collagen                                | - Deep Second Degree Burns<br>- For blistered skin, remove blister and apply collagen                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Skin graft]]                                 | - For 2nd-degree and 3rd-degree burns<br> - Indicated when the dermis is exposed                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Topical Antimicrobial Prophylaxis              | - Indicated for deep partial-thickness burns and full-thickness burns<br> - Example: mupirocin                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Debridement                                    | - Indicated when the dermis is exposed (partial-thickness or full-thickness burns)<br> - Aids in wound healing                                                                                                                                                                   |
