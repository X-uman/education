### Tokyo guidelines for severity
- no systemic symptoms of [[Inflammation]]: Grade I
- severe inflammation: Grade II if any one of following
	- WBC count >18,000
	- Symptoms >3d
	- Palpable tender swelling
	- evidence of [[gangrenous cholecystitis]], [[emphysematous cholecystitis]], [[liver abscess]] or [[pericholecystic abscess]] 

- [[Multiorgan dysfunction]]: Grade III if any:
	- Cardiovascular: [[Hypotension]] requiring [[dopamine]] or [[Noradrenaline]] 
	- Neurological: [[Altered consciousness]]
	- Respiratory: [[adult respiratory distress syndrome]]
	- Renal: [[Acute Kidney Injury]]
	- Hepatic: [[INR]] > 1.5
	- Hematologic: [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]]

## Investigations:
- [[Inflammatory markers]]
- [[USG]]: 
	- [[Cholelithiasis]], [[biliary sludge]], and gallbladder distension, thickening, edema, air in wall, as in [[pneumatosis intestinalis]] 
	- pericholecystic free fluid
- Gold standard: [[HIDA scan]] 
- MRI: [[choledocholithiasis]] as [[MRCP]]
- [[CECT]]: similar findings as in USG
## Management

**- Surgical candidates: treatment of choice is early [[Laparascopic cholecystectomy]] within 72hrs** (up to 10 days)
	Antibiotic usage: 
		- Grade I: No antibiotics required after surgery
		- Grade II: antibiotics for 24 hrs. after surgery
		- Grade III: antibiotics for 4-7 days after surgery

**Not surgical candidates [[ASA grading]] (Defined as CCI ≥ 6 and/or ASA‐PS ≥ 3 by the 2018 Tokyo guidelines)**
	- Grade I: Antibiotics until improvement
	- Grade II: Antibiotics until improvement, if not deteriorated, Urgent [[gallbladder drainage]] + antibiotics for 7 days
	- Grade III: urgent gallbladder drainage + antibiotics for 7 days
- Interval cholecystectomy: An elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy that is typically performed ~ 6 weeks after the resolution of an acute biliary disease (e.g. acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis).


## Complications
- [[gallbladder empyema]]
- [[gallbladder perforation]] 
- [[Peritonitis]] 
- [[pericholecystic abscess]]
- [[subhepatic abscess]] 
- [[liver abscess]]
- [[Gangrene]]
- [[cholecystoenteric fistula]] 
- [[chronic cholecystitis]]
