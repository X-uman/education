Bartter's syndrome is an inherited cause (usually autosomal recessive) of severe hypokalemia due to defective chloride absorption at the Na+ K+ 2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2) in the ascending loop of Henle. 
It should be noted that it is associated with normotension (unlike other endocrine causes of hypokalemia such as Conn's, Cushing's and Liddle's syndrome which are associated with hypertension).
Loop diuretics work by inhibiting NKCC2 - think of Bartter's syndrome as like taking large doses of furosemide
