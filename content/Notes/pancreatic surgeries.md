| Distal pancreatectomy + Splenectomy                    | Also known as the Child-Duval procedure, involves removal of the distal portion of the pancreas along with the spleen.                                                                                                      |                                                              |
| Duodenum preserving pancreatic head resection          | Beger's procedure, with Bern's modification, preserves the duodenum while resecting the pancreatic head to treat chronic pancreatitis, benign masses                                                                        |                                                              |
| Whipple operation                                      | Surgical procedure used for suspected malignancy involving the head of the pancreas, which includes removal of the head of the pancreas, duodenum, and a portion of the stomach and bile ducts, followed by reconstruction. |                                                              |
| Frey procedure                                         | Involves lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (creating a connection between the pancreas and jejunum) alongside head resection of the pancreas.                                                                                  | Drainage + Resection of pancreas in [[chronic pancreatitis]] |
| Puestow procedure                                      | Involves creating a longitudinal incision in the pancreas and anastomosing it to the jejunum. if  7 mm dilatation of pancreatic duct                                                                                        | Drainage in chronic pancreatitis                             |
| Izbicki procedure                                      | V-shaped cut and anastomosis for < 7 mm dilatation                                                                                                                                                                          | Drainage in chronic pancreatitis                             |
| Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant (TPIAT) | A last-line curative therapy for chronic pancreatitis, involves removal of the entire pancreas, followed by isolation and transplantation of islet cells back into the patient to preserve insulin production.              |                                                              |
