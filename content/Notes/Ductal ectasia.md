**Mammary duct ectasia** is the abnormal widening of one or more breast ducts to greater than 2 mm diameter, or 3 mm at the ampulla. It can be due to benign or malignant processes. Some publications use this term synonymously with periductal mastitis or plasma cell mastitis, while others suggest that they are distinct entities with a different pathogenesis 

### Pathophysiology
- dilatation of the terminal (subareolar) lactiferous ducts
- Ductal [[Obstruction]] and extravasation of contents
- chronic inflammation around duct, may form abscess or even fistula
- Chronic indurated mass may form beneath the areola, which mimics a carcinoma
- Inspissation of debris and secretions within dilated ducts and lateral calcification of ductal contents
- Fibrosis may cause slit like [[Nipple retraction]]  
- Associated with smoking, malignancy 
#### Pathology
- Periductal inflammation and/or fibrosis
- The ductal lumens may be obliterated or filled with inspissated secretions and inflammatory cells.
- Foamy histiocytes are characteristically present within the inflammatory infiltrate.
### Epidemiology
- It is more common in females in an age group of 50-60 years (i.e. postmenopausal). It is very rarely seen in males. It can occasionally be seen in children
- Seen in [[Perimenopause]] 
### Presentation
- Ductal ectasia is often asymptomatic, especially when benign. However, patients with ductal ectasia may present with nonspecific breast symptoms:
	- [[Nipple discharge]] : Unilateral or bilateral non-milky gray, greenish, or bloody discharge
	- nipple retraction/inversion 
	- noncyclical pain/tenderness
	- palpable mass


### Diagnostics
|Age|Breast Imaging Modality|
|---|---|
|< 30 years|Breast Ultrasound|
|≥ 30 years|Mammography with adjunctive Ultrasound|

- Mammography
	- Bilateral, sub-areolar findings of duct ectasia may confidently be assessed as benign (BI-RADS 1 or 2).
	- Asymmetric finding without demonstrated stability warrants further evaluation with USG
	- A solitary dilated duct, a rare type of asymmetric duct ectasia, is suspicious for malignancy and biopsy should be considered
- USG: Features that on ultrasound should raise suspicion for malignancy include non-sub areolar location, hypoechoic intraluminal contents, ductal wall irregularity or indistinctness, or solid parenchymal mass

### Management
- Expectant management is usually sufficient as most cases resolve spontaneously
- Consider surgical duct excision  for patients with: 
	- Nipple discharge 
	- Other persistent symptoms
	- Non-diagnostic biopsy
- Difficult to treat
- Medical: Amoxicillin, or Flucloxacillin + Metronidazole
- Surgery: [[Hadfield's operation]]
