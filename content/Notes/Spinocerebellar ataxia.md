- Primarily autosomal dominant inheritance
- Currently, more than 30 different mutations have been identified, including:
	    - SCA1: mutation on chromosome 6; corresponding protein is Ataxin-1
	    - SCA2: mutation on chromosome 12; corresponding protein is Ataxin-2
	    - SCA3: mutation on chromosome 14; corresponding protein is Ataxin-3

- CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion is a common feature 

### Diagnostics
Neuroimaging (CT/MRI): cerebellar atrophy is a finding common to all SCAs Molecular genetic testing: precise identification of SCA type

### Presentation
- [[Cerebellar signs]] 
- [[Optic atrophy]]
- [[Dementia]]
- [[Extrapyramidal movement disorders]]
- [[Pigmentary maculopathy]]
