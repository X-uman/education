### Definitions 

### Pathophysiology
- Impaired mucus clearance: e.g., bronchial neoplasms, cystic fibrosis, impacted lower airway foreign body
- Hematogenous spread of bacteria: e.g., tricuspid valve endocarditis or Lemierre syndrome
- Contiguous spread (direct extension): e.g., liver abscess, pleural empyema, mediastinitis
- Direct inoculation: e.g., penetrating chest injury
- Complication of necrotizing pneumonia

### Clinical presentation
- Fever, night sweats
- Pleuritic [[Chest Pain]]
- [[Hemoptysis]]
- [[Clubbing]]
- Amphoric [[Lung Sounds|Lung Sounds]] may be present over the lung abscess

### Diagnostics
- Radiology: Air-fluid level
	- Aspiration: Right middle lobe
	- Posterior segments of the upper lobes or the superior segments of the lower lobes (typically caused by aspiration in the recumbent position).
	- Due to hematogenous dissemination: typically bilateral and multiple 
- CBC, blood culture, 
- Gram stain and culture of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage
- Additional
	- [[HIV screening]]
	- Gram stain and culture of aspirate of abscess
- For possible underlying cause
	- Bronchoscopy for suspected malignancy or lower airway foreign body
	- Echocardiography for suspected septic endocarditis
	- Clinical swallow assessment for suspected dysphagia

### Management
- [[broad spectrum antibiotics]] 
- Interventional therapy for large abscess, significant hemoptysis
	- bronchoscopic drainage or image-guided percutaneous drainage
	- Rarely, Surgical resection may be needed

### Complications
- Extension or rupture into the pleural cavity, causing: 
- Pleural empyema
- Pleural effusion
- [[Bronchopulmonary fistula]]
- Pneumothorax
- Recurrence of abscess
- Development of chronic reactive changes: e.g., bronchiectasis or pneumatoceles
- [[Massive hemoptysis]]
