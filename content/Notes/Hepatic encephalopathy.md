### Definition
- Brain dysfunction caused by [[Hepatic insufficiency]] and or [[Portosystemic Anastomosis]] and manifests as a wide spectrum of psychiatric/neurological abnormalities ranging from subclinical alterations to coma
### Etiology
- [[Notes/Hyperammonemia|Hyperammonemia]]
### Classification
4-axis nomenclature while diagnosing HE

| Axis              | Classification                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type              | A: [[Acute liver failure]]<br>B: [[TIPSS]]<br>C: [[cirrhosis]] |
| Underlying cause  | Spontaneous/precipitated                                      |
| Course of disease | Episodic (every 6 months)<br>Recurrent <br>persistent         |
| Severity          | [[West Haven Criteria]] (covert and overt)                    |


### Pathogenesis
- [[Notes/Hyperammonemia|Hyperammonemia]] due to impaired [[Urea cycle]] in liver
- Ammonia crosses [[Blood brain barrier]]
- Taken up by [[Astrocytes]]
	- Direct astrocyte injury leads to inflammation
	- Increased glutamate inside astrocyte acts as osmotic agent and draws water into astrocyte
	- Glutamate increases GABA (CNS depressant)
	- 
### Clinical features
- [[West Haven Criteria]] 
### Diagnostics
- Serum ammonia level (arterial) but its level does not correlate with severity 
- CSF Glutamate: correlates with severity
- EEG: 
	- Triphasic wave seen till Grade III/IV
	- In deep coma: Delta waves

### Management
- remove excess ammonia
	- Lactulose
	- Sodium benzoic acid
	- Urea cycle stimulation: L-ornithine, L-aspartate and Zinc
- [[ICP monitoring]]
- [[ICP management]]
- Treat underlying cause
