### Monitoring
- [[Fibrinogen]] level is a more sensitive indicator of ongoing major blood loss than the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, or platelet count.
- The fall is likely related to loss of fibrinogen through bleeding, increased fibrinolytic activity, and hemodilution from fluids given to support blood pressure, and the contribution of each of these factors may be affected by the cause of PPH
- fibrinogen depletion is an early predictor of hemorrhage severity and can be used to guide the aggressiveness of management
### Management
- Medical
	- Fibrin glues and patches to cover areas of oozing and promote clotting
	- [[Tranexamic acid]] 
	- Recombinant human factor VIIa as an adjunctive agent
- Non-surgical
	- Tamponade using
		- Packing
		- Tourniquet
- Surgical
	- Surgical repair
	- Curettage of bleeding site and repair
	- Compression suture: Placement of figure 8 sutures or other hemostatic sutures directly into the placental bed
	- Arterial compression by ligation/cross clamping 
	- Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) 
- Interventional
	- Angiography
	- Selective Arterial embolization
	- Intermittent aortic balloon occlusion
