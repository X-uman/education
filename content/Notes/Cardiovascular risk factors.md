### Risk management in heart failure
Here's the information presented in a tabulated format:

| Condition               | Treatment Recommendation                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hypertension            | Treatment target of < 130/80 mm Hg                                                   |
| Diabetes Mellitus       | SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for all patients                                    |
| Iron Deficiency         | Parenteral iron therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic HFrEF or HFmrEF |
|                         | - Initial dosing is based on hemoglobin levels:                                      |
|                         | - Hgb ≤ 14 g/dL: ferric carboxymaltose 1000 mg IV once                               |
|                         | - Hgb 14–14.9 g/dL: **Ferric carboxymaltose 500 mg IV once**                         |
|                         | - Subsequent doses are based on patient weight and hemoglobin and ferritin levels    |
| Obesity                 | Consider semaglutide (off-label) in patients with HFpEF                              |
| Obstructive Sleep Apnea | Consider nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy                |
