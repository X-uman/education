- [[Color flow doppler USG]]
A noninvasive imaging modality that combines ultrasound imaging of vessels with Doppler assessment of blood flow. An arterial duplex scan can be used to identify the site and severity of arterial occlusion in [[peripheral arterial disease]] as well as to diagnose [[aneurysms]]. 
Venous duplex scan is the test of choice to identify the patency of deep veins (e.g., in suspected [[Deep vein thrombosis]])
	- Non-compressibility of the affected vein is the most important sonographic feature of DVT. 

- identify venous reflux and the site of incompetent valves in chronic venous insufficiency.
	- Reflux is elicited during the study from below (via manual compression of a vein or use of a cuff) or above (using the Valsalva maneuver). 
	-Superficial or crural vein reflux is defined as retrograde flow in the reverse direction to physiological flow lasting for 0.5 seconds or more. 
	The proximal deep veins require a duration of 1 second or more to be classified as incompetent. 
	Reflux may be elicited by release of a calf or foot squeeze for proximal or calf varicosities, respectively, manual compression over varicosity clusters, pneumatic calf cuff deflation, active foot dorsiflexion and relaxation or the Valsalva maneuver.

- Color duplex ultrasonography (also known as color flow mapping) provides color-coding of flow direction (red = towards the transducer, blue = away from the transducer) and flow rate (the brighter the color, the faster the flow rate). Motionless structures are represented in grayscale according to echogenicity.
