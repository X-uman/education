### Risk factors
- Approximately 15 percent of those diagnosed with atypical placental site nodule will develop, or have concurrent, ETT within 16 months of diagnosis
- 
### Pathology
- discrete, hemorrhagic, solid, and cystic lesion that is located either in the fundus, lower uterine segment, or endocervix
- like PSTT, it forms tumor nodules in the myometrium.
- Microscopically, the tumor is composed of a relatively uniform population of mononucleate intermediate trophoblastic cells forming nests and solid masses
- ETT cells show diffuse expression of immunohistochemical markers, including cytokeratin and inhibin A
- Cyclin E staining is higher in ETT than placental site nodules, which can help differentiate between the two
### Presentation
- clinical behavior of ETT is similar to PSTT
- Like PSTT, time interval from antecedent pregnancy is highly prognostic
- Diagnosis is typically late in the course of disease due to slow growth, paucity of symptoms, and low or absent hCG production
- Due to late diagnosis, approximately 50 percent of patients with ETT present with metastatic disease
