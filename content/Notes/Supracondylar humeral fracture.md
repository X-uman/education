### Etiology
- FOOSH in children due to 
	- Ligamentous laxity
	- Incomplete ossification
	- Metaphysis is located between 2 fossae
- Mechanism
	- Hyper-extension
	- Direct-trauma

### Types of displacement
- Posterior angulation/displacement - 95%
- Anterior angulation/displacement/flexion type: rare

### Classification
| **Type**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type I**             | Non-displaced or minimally displaced supracondylar fracture.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Type II**            | Fracture with a complete displacement, but with an **intact posterior cortex.**                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Type III**           | Complete displacement with no cortical contact between the fracture fragments.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Type III Extension** | Type III fracture with extensive comminution and extension into the metaphysis. This extension increases the instability of the fracture.                                                                                                                 |
| **Type IV**            | Fracture with complete displacement and a rotational component, often involving the entire humeral condyle. The fracture line may extend into the shaft.                                                                                                  |
| **Type V**             | Severely comminuted fractures involving the entire distal humerus, extending into the diaphysis. These fractures are often associated with significant soft tissue injury and vascular compromise, making them highly unstable and challenging to manage. |

### Presentation
- Attitude: Posterior, medial, Internal rotated
- S-shaped deformity of elbow in posterior displacement
- [[Carrying angle]]
- [[3 Bony points relations]] is maintained
- Swelling

### Diagnostics
- Fat pad sign on Plain X-ray seen in Type I fracture
- Fish-tail sign 

### Management
- Undisplaced: Splinting
- Displaced
	- Unstable: Percutaneous pinning with K-wire
	- Failed closed reduction: [[Open reduction]] with [[Internal Fixation]] 
- [[Neurovascular Examination]] 
	- Commonest injured vessel is brachial artery
	- Commonest injured nerve is Anterior interosseous nerve
### Complications
- [[Complications of fracture]] 
- Early: Brachial artery injury/blockage
- Intermediate: [[Volkmann's ischemic contracture]]
- Later: 
	- [[Gun-stock deformity]] due to malunion
	- [[Volkmann's ischemic contracture]]
