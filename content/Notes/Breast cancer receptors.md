| Estrogen Receptor (ER)     | - Positive in approximately 70% of cases                                                                                   | Premenopausal: Tamoxifen, [[GnRH agonists]] <br>Postmenopausal: [[aromatase inhibitors]]<br>Preventive: raloxifene |
| Progesterone Receptor (PR) | - Positive in approximately 70% of cases                                                                                   |                                                                                                                    |
| HER2/neu                   | - Positive (overexpression) in ~20% of cases <br> - Associated with aggressive tumor behavior                              | [[Trastuzumab]]                                                                                                    |
| Triple-Negative (TNBC)     | - All receptors are absent<br> - Represents approximately 10% of cases <br> - Typically more aggressive, high-grade tumors | Needs chemotherapy                                                                                                 |
#### Management 
- hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
- Adjuvant chemotherapy for tumors larger than 1 cm in diameter and/or breast cancer that is hormone receptor-negative/HER2-positive
- Adjuvant targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer
