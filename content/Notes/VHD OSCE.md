### Chief complaints
- [[Dyspnea]]
- [[Palpitation]] 
- [[Syncope]] 
### Examination
- [[Mitral facies]] 
- [[Cardiovascular system examination]] 
	- [[Pulse]]: may be irregularly irregular
	- [[Apex-Pulse deficit]] 
	- BP may be low
	- [[Jugular Venous Pressure]] may be raised
- Chest examination
	- [[Parasternal heave]] + ve
	- [[Apical impulse]]: Tapping, shifted out 
- [[Respiratory system examination]]
	- Basal crepitation on auscultation 
- Heart sounds
	- S1: Loud. S2 normal
	- Opening span
	- [[S3 (heart sounds)]]: No change
	- [[S4 (heart sounds)]]  may be audible due to atrial kick (in case atrial fibrillation is absent)
	- [[Notes/Murmurs|Murmurs]] 
		- Timing: Diastolic (mid)
		- Character: Low pitch
		- Grade: Any
		- Pre-systolic accentuation due to atrial contraction
### Provisional diagnosis
- Mitral stenosis
### Diagnostics
- [[Electrocardiography]] 
	- [[Atrial fibrillation]]
	- [[P-wave]]: P-mitrale
	- Right axis deviation
	- Tall QRS complexes in right leads (V1, V2)
- [[Chest X-ray]] 
	- Double border of right atrial area due to LA enlargement
	- BL [[pulmonary edema]] in lower lung zones
	- [[Cardiomegaly]] with out shifting
- [[Echocardiography]]
