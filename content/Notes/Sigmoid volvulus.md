### Patho-anatomy
- **Sigmoid Colon**
  - Commonly affected by volvulus.
  - More prevalent in old males.
  - High fiber diet increases the risk due to redundant sigmoid colon.
- **Sigmoid Mesocolon**
  - Long mesocolon increases the chances of volvulus.
  - Anticlockwise rotation is more common. (all other volvulus are mostly clockwise)

### Investigations for Sigmoid Volvulus
- **X-ray features**
	- Bent inner tube appearance or Coffee bean appearance on imaging.
	- **Barium Enema** Shows Bird's beak or Ace of spades appearance.

### Management Steps
- **Sigmoidoscopic Reduction and Decompression**
	   - Initial management to relieve acute symptoms.
	   - Insertion of a rectal tube to decompress.
- **Definitive Treatment: Sigmoid Colectomy**
	   - Surgical intervention to prevent recurrence and complications.
