- Description
	- Third-degree AV block is a complete block with no conduction between the atria and ventricles.
	- P waves and QRS complexes have their own regular rhythm but bear no relationship to each other (AV dissociation).
- Risk of progression to [[cardiogenic shock]] or [[Cardiac arrest]] : High; Sudden onset 3Â° AV block can result in ventricular [[asystole]], which lasts until an [[Escape rhythms]] takes over, which can be generated by sites that are usually located near the AV node or near the bundle of His.
- Idiopathic paroxysmal AV block 
	- A subtype of third-degree AV block that can affect patients with otherwise normal AV conduction.
	- Recurrent episodes may lead to Stokes-Adams attacks.
