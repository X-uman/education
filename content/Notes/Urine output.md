	Best measure of tissue perfusion

- [burns] Urine Monitoring
	- For >14 y, 0.5ml/kg/hr
	- For <14 y, 1ml/kg/hr
	- For 4th degree, electrical burns, 1.5ml/kg/hr
	- For High voltage burns with [[myoglobinuria]], 2ml/kg/hr

- Complete [[anuria]] early in the course of AKI is uncommon except in the following situations: complete urinary tract obstruction, renal artery occlusion, overwhelming [[septic shock]], severe [[ischemia]] (often with cortical necrosis), or severe proliferative glomerulonephritis or [[vasculitis]].
(COMPLETE=COMPLETE)

- A reduction in urine output ([[oliguria]], defined as <400 mL/24 h) usually denotes more severe AKI (i.e., lower GFR) than when urine output is preserved. Oliguria is associated with worse clinical outcomes in AKI.

- Preserved urine output can be seen in [[nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]] characteristic of long-standing urinary tract obstruction, tubulointerstitial disease, or nephrotoxicity from cisplatin or [[aminoglycosides]], among other causes.
