- Due to smaller chorionic plate than basal plate. The chorionic plate does not extend to the placental margin.
- Cause: Probably due to recurrent Marginal Hemorrhage
- Types: 
	- Placenta marginata
	- Circumvallate placenta
- Clinical implications: Recurrent hemorrhage in pregnancy, mid-trimester bleeding, threatened abortion, IUGR, preterm delivery, retained placenta or membranes, and hydrorrhea gravidarum (excess watery vaginal discharge).

### Classification
- Circumvallate Placenta
	- Fetal surface is divided into:
		- Central depressed zone surrounded by
		- Thickened white ring which is usually complete situated at varying distance from margin of placenta Composed of Double fold of Amnion and Chorion with degenerated decidua vera and fibrin in between
	- Vessels radiate from cord insertion as far as the ring and then disappear from view
	- Peripheral zone outside the ring is thicker and edge is elevated and rounded
- Placenta Marginata
	- The fibrinous ring is present at the margin of Chorionic plate where the fetal vessels appear to terminate. That is the white ring is located at the margin of placenta
