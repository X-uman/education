### Introduction

### Etiologies
- Primary VUR (most common type) 
- Short intramural ureter → vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) fails to close completely during bladder contraction → VUR
- Secondary VUR
	- [[Bladder outlet obstruction]](anatomic/functional): high pressure within the bladder → reflux of urine through the VUJ
	- Cystitis
	- Congenital anomalies of the ureter
	- Ureteral duplication (most common renal abnormality; 1% of the population)
	- Ectopic ureter
	- Ureterocele
	- Iatrogenic

### Clinical features
- VUR is generally asymptomatic until it causes a urinary tract infection.
- Suspected in [[Antenatal USG]] on seeing [[Hydronephrosis]]
- Recurrent febrile [[UTI]] like [[Pyelonephritis]] 
- [[Reflux nephropathy]] leads to CKD
### Diagnostics
- [[Urine Analysis]]
- [[RFT]]
- Imaging: in children with febrile UTI and for follow-ups
- [[Micturating cystourethrogram]] helps to diagnose and grade the disease

| Grade     | Findings on Voiding Cystourethrogram                                                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grade I   | - Reflux limited to the ureter<br>- No ureteral dilation                                                                      |
| Grade II  | - Reflux up to the renal pelvis<br>- No ureteral dilation                                                                     |
| Grade III | - Reflux up to the renal pelvis<br>- Mild dilation of the ureter<br>- Blunting of the calyces                                 |
| Grade IV  | - Reflux up to the renal pelvis<br>- Gross dilation of the ureter<br>- Moderate ureteral tortuosity                           |
| Grade V   | - Gross dilatation of the ureter, pelvis, and calyces<br>- Significant ureteral tortuosity<br>- Loss of papillary impressions |

### Management
| **Conservative Treatment**                                           | **Surgical Treatment**                                                            |

| - VUR grades I–III in children < 5 years of age                      | - VUR ≥ grade IV                                                                  |
| **Long-term Prophylactic Antibiotics:**                              | - Bilateral grade III VUR, especially in children > 6 years                       |
| - Children > 3 months: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin | - Worsening renal function or breakthrough UTIs                                   |
| - Infants < 2 months: amoxicillin                                    | **Sub Ureteric Transurethral Injection (STING Procedure)**                        |
| **Correction of Voiding Dysfunction:**                               | - Cystoscopy-guided injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid                      |
| - Behavior modification (e.g., timed voiding every 3 hours)          | - Keeps the intravesical ureter in place and alters its angle, correcting the VUR |
| - Prevention of constipation                                         | - Day-care procedure with success rates of up to 90%                              |
| **Close Surveillance:**                                              | **Surgery: Ureteral Reimplantation (Ureteroneocystostomy)**                       |
| - Urinalysis, renal imaging                                          |                                                                                   |
