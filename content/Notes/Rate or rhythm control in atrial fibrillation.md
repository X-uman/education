- [[Factors-favouring-rate-versus-rhythm-control.png]]
- Rhythm: Young, new, symptomatic, non-hypertensive, AF exacerbates HF, anti-arrhythmic drugs have worked before


### Rate control
- [[Beta-Blockers]], [[Calcium Channel blockers]], [[Digoxin]] , [[Amiodarone]]
- Surgical: [[AV nodal ablation]] 

### Rhythm control
 - Goals
    - Termination of atrial fibrillation (or flutter)
    - Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm
    - Symptom improvement
    - Prevention of atrial remodeling
- Cardioversion options
    - Planned [[electrical cardioversion]]
    - [[Pharmacological cardioversion]] 
    - [[Interventional cardioversion]] 
- Long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy: Consider in patients with a low risk of adverse effects.
    - Goal: to maintain sinus rhythm and reduce the frequency and duration of Afib episodes in patients with recurrent Afib 
	- Options include amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol.
