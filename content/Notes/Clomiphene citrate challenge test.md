- A test used to evaluate for [[diminished ovarian reserve]] (DOR) in women with unexplained infertility. 
- Involves measuring serum FSH concentration on day 3 of the menstrual cycle, giving clomiphene citrate on days 5-9, and retesting serum FSH concentration on day 10. 
- Increased serum FSH concentrations after clomiphene citrate administration suggest DOR.
