- [[Lungs]] 
- [[Chronic bronchitis]] 
- [[Emphysema]]
- [[Asthma]] 
### Pathogenesis
1. GETomincs: [[Taxonomy of COPD]] 
	- Gene: Serpina 1 gene
	- Environment: Smoking, Pollution, fumes
	- Time: Lifetime
2. Smoking in Normal population vs COPD in Anti-trypsin deficient individual? = Panacinar Emphysema
3. Environmental pollution
4. [[Alpha1-antitrypsin]] deficiency

Partially reversible... some asthma are also only partially reversible 

### presentation
- Chronic smoker
- [[Dyspnea]]: Insidious and progressive in nature [[mMRC Grade]] 
- Cough: Productive cough due to mucus production in airways [[Chronic bronchitis]] 

##### Clinical examination 
- [[Hyperinflation]] of lungs produce [[barrel chest]]
- Tripod position to use [[Scalene muscles]]: Dermatitis of thigh: Dahl sign
- Hollowing of Supraclavicular fossa
- Hypertrophic SCM
- Inspiratory tracheal descent
- Prominent Sternal Luis
- Exaggerated thoracic [[kyphosis]]
- Obtuse subcostal angle
- Hourglass groove: Harrison sulcus due to centripetal contraction of diaphragm
- Narrowing of Subcostal angle during inspiration: Hoover sign 
- Purse lip breathing 
- [[Dahl-sign-hyperpigmentation.jpeg]] 
### Diagnosis
- [[Chest X-ray]] 
- [[Pulmonary function tests]] 
- [[CT-scan]]: [[Saber-sheath trachea]] is pathognomonic of COPD 
- Grade the severity of disease
	- clinically using [[mMRC Grade]] from patient history as 0,1, 2,3,4 
	- CAT Assessment 
	- [[GOLD scale]] 1,2,3,4 from spirometry 
	- No of Exacerbations per year
	- [[BODE Index]] 
### Treatment
- Reduce [[inflammation]]
	- Stop the progression of disease by Removing the agent: [[Cessation of Cigarette smoke]], Pollutants
	- Give Anti-inflammatory agents: [[Glucocorticoids]]
- For narrowed airways, give [[bronchodilators]]
- Before giving drugs, you have to classify the patients into 3 groups

### Management 
1. A: Mild symptoms
	- LABA or LAMA
	- Or consider only rescue medication for patients with very occassional dyspnea
---
1. B: Severe symptoms
	- LABA + LAMA combination
---
- E: frequent ==Exacerbations== (>=2/year or >=1 requiring hospital admission) , irrespective of severity of obstruction
	- LAMA + LABA or 
	- LAMA + LABA + Glucocorticoids if indicated 
- B,E are more severe forms, they require Vaccinations to prevent Flu and pneumonia from pneumococcus
- B and E: [[Pulmonary Rehabilitation]] is also needed 
##### Glucocorticoids
- Used for patients with more exacerbations and eosinophilic phenotypes Eosinophil count >300/dl
- De-escalate if Pneumonia or side effects, de-escalation not advised in high eosinophils count
- LAMA + LABA not effective && Eosinophil count > 100/dl
##### Rescue medication
- SABA or SAMA
### Follow up treatment
##### Persistent dyspnea
- Monotherapy converted into LAMA+ LABA e.g. umeclidinium/vilanterol 
- Combinatioin therapy: consider changing inhaler or medication within the same class
##### Persistent exacerbations
Triple therapy: fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol

| Initial therapy | Eosinophils > 300 | Eosinophils < 300 | Eosinophils > 100 | Eosinophils < 100           |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| LAMA/LABA       | LAMA+LABA+ICS     | LAMA+LABA         |                   |                             |
| LABA/ICS        | LAMA+LABA+ICS     | LAMA+LABA         |                   |                             |
| LAMA+LABA       |                   |                   | Add ICS           | Azithromycin or Roflumilast |
| Triple therapy  |                   |                   |                   | Azithromycin or Roflumilast |

- Glucocorticoids if Eosinophils >300 or, > 100 with no symptom resolution even after combination treatment
- Eosinophils < 100: 
	- Azithromycin in former smokers, or if repeated exacerbations are there
	- [[roflumilast]] if FeV1 < 50% or Chronic bronchitis
- Avoid [[Beta-Blockers]] and [[Statins]] (not useful)
- Other drugs
	- [[Theophylline]]
	- [[expectorants and mucolytics]] can help reduce exacerbations in certain patients
### Advanced disease
- [[Domiciliary oxygen]] 
- [[CPAP]] for patients with COPD+ [[Obstructive sleep apnea]]
- Long term [[Non-invasive Positive pressure ventilation]] with severe chronic hypercapnia
- Invasive surgeries
	- Bullectomy
	- [[Lung volume reduction]]
	- [[Lung transplantation]]
