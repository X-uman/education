### Mechanical methods 
- graduated compression stockings (GCS), 
- intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices
- Avoided in patients with [[peripheral arterial disease]] 

### Pharmacological 
- pharmacologic agents such as unfractionated heparin for renal insufficiency 
- low-molecular-weight heparin: choice in absence of [[CKD]] 
- and fondaparinux/bivalirudin for [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] risk 

Patients in the medium- or high-risk groups should be considered for pharmacological prophylaxis with an anticoagulant medication.
