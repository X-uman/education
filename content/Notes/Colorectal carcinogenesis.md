| **Chromosomal Instability Pathway**    | The adenoma-carcinoma sequence progresses as follows: **APC** gene mutation (loss of cellular adhesion and increased cellular proliferation) → **KRAS** gene mutation (unregulated cellular signaling and cellular proliferation) → **TP53** and DCC gene mutation. This pathway is responsible for the slow transformation of adenomas into carcinomas, and it is the most common route for the development of sporadic colorectal cancer.  |
| **Microsatellite Instability Pathway** | - Due to methylation or mutations in mismatch repair genes (MMR genes, e.g., MLH1 or MSH2).<br> - Hypermethylation phenotype pathway in colon cancer.<br> - CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP): global hypermethylation of CpG islands → silencing of MMR gene expression.<br> - Associated with BRAF mutations.<br> - Up to 20% of sporadic CRCs develop from serrated polyps that underwent malignant transformation via this pathway. |
| **COX-2 Overexpression**               | - Associated with colorectal cancer.<br> - Possible protective effect of long-term use of aspirin and other NSAIDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
