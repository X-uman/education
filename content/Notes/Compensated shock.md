- compensated shock: [[end-organ perfusion]] maintained in kidneys, liver, brain, lost volume <= 15% 
- [[Occult hypoperfusion]] 
- Peripheral vasoconstriction
- Manifests with cold, clammy extremities and increased capillary refill time 
- Decreased capillary hydrostatic pressure â†’ increased absorption of interstitial fluids into intravascular space to help maintain blood pressure
- Peripheral vasoconstriction may be absent in distributive shock.
- Tachycardia (Patients with neurogenic shock may present with bradycardia.)
- Oliguria
