- Abbreviated Injury scale AIS: 9
### Introduction
- 
### Pathophysiology
- Locally
	- Zone of coagulation: Irreversible
	- Zone of stasis: Reversible, but vulnerable to ischemic injury 
	- Zone of hyperemia: Normal, fully reversible
- Systemically
	- [[dehydration]] 
	- [[SIRS]] and [[Multiorgan dysfunction]] 
	- Increased [[Capillary permeability]] leading to [[Notes/shock|shock]] 
### Initial management
- Ampicillin (or any other systemic antibiotic) is currently not recommended for prophylaxis of infections in burn patients because of a lack of supporting evidence.
- Indications for admission from Schwartz
	- More than 20% partial thickness >10 years
	- More than 10% partial thickness <10 years
	- More than 5% full thickness in any age
	- Eyes, Face, fingers, genitalia
	- Electrical, chemical, suspicious burns
	- Nobody to take care, psychiatric patients
	- Patient's comorbidities
	- Smoke inhalation
- Because fluid resuscitation can worsen laryngeal edema, intubation should be performed as early as possible, if necessary.  
- [[Endotracheal intubation]] is indicated if an inhalation injury is suspected or if burns involve > 30% TBSA. 
	- Airway management if singeing of hair, hoarseness, stridor, then intubate prophylactically
- Circulation: Cut-down Great saphenous vein, fluid 16-18G cannula and parkland formula
- ICU/Burn center admission if
	- 2nd-degree burns involving > 10% of TBSA or 3rd-degree burns involving > 5% of TBSA
	- Inhalation injury
	- Burns involving the hands, feet, genitalia, or major joints
	- High-voltage electrical burns and chemical burns
