### Introduction
- Autosomal dominant inheritance
- Expression of DUX4 Gene which produces a protein toxic to Muscle cells
- [[Chromosome 4]] 4q35 region 
- Leads to Muscle degeneration and fat infiltration

### Presentation
- Earliest: Facial muscle weakness resembling [[Facial nerve palsy]] 
- Scapular muscle weakness
	- [[Winging of Scapula]]
	- Inability to raise hands above shoulder
- Abdominal weakness
	- Protruded abdomen (Like [[Vitamin D deficiency]] leading to [[Rickets]]) 
	- **Beevor sign**: LA > UA Affected, so Umbilicus moves towards the head when flexing neck
	- Exaggerated [[Lordosis]] 
- Limb muscles
	- Instability
	- Falls
	- Cannot climb up stairs
- Muscle aches
- Hearing loss in severe early onset disease 
- [[Retinal vasculopathy]]
- Cardiorespiratory manifestations
	- Cardiac: [[Arrhythmias]]
	- [[Respiratory failure]]

### Diagnosis
- Confirmation: Mutation of gene regulating DUX4 expression
