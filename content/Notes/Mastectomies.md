### Intraoperative LN evaluation
- Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB)
	- Used to assess whether cancer cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes and helps to identify the axillary lymph node that initially drains the tumorous breast tissue 
	- Indicated for all patients with no clinical signs of axillary lymph node infiltration
	- Must be performed during breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy
	- If the sentinel lymph node is negative, the likelihood of other nodes in this group being involved is very low.
- Axillary dissection
	- Removal of â‰¥ 10 lymph nodes during surgery with subsequent histopathologic examination
	- Indicated for patients with clinical signs of axillary lymph node infiltration
	- Can be performed during primary surgery (e.g., mastectomy) or after 

### Complications
- Injury of Axillary vein
- [[Seroma]]
- Shoulder dysfunction
- Pain and numbness
- [[Flap]] necrosis
- [[Lymphedema]]
- Winging of scapula
- Thoracodorsal nerve injury: weak adduction and Internal rotation
