### Pathogenesis
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]] 
- [[Fetal lung maturity]] 
- [[Surfactant deficiency]] 
- [[Diffuse alveolar damage]] 
	- alveolar epithelium necrosis
	- Exudation: Protein rich plasma
	- Fibrin converted into fibrinogen in the alveolar surface which appears as eosinophilic membrane overlying alveoli, which makes the [[Respiratory membrane]] thick and decreases Oxygen diffusion leading to [[Respiratory failure]] 

---
### Presentation
- Symptoms begin immediately after birth  or within 6 h after birth 
- Signs of [[Respiratory distress]] 
- Decreased breath sounds 
- Signs of [[Hypoxemia]] 

---
### Diagnostics
- Chest imaging
	- [[Pulmonary edema]]
	- [[Ground glass opacity]]
	- [[Air bronchograms]] 
	- Diffuse reticulo-nodular opacities
- [[ABG]] 

---
### Management
- [[Silverman scoring]]
- Mild RDS: [[CPAP]] 
- Moderate to severe cases 
	- [[Neonatal intubation]] 
	- DOC: [[Surfactant therapy]] through [[Endotracheal tube]] 
	- If respiratory failure persists: [[Mechanical Ventilation]] with [[Lung protective ventilation]] 
- [[Supportive care for neonate]] 

---
### Complications
- [[Perinatal asphyxia]] related 

---
### Prevention
- [[Fetal lung maturity|Antenatal corticosteroids]] 
---
### Differential diagnosis
- [[Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis]] 
	- Term neonate presenting with severe RDS soon after birth with chest X-ray showing ground-glass haziness, 
	- no improvement with [[Surfactant therapy]] and history of similar illness in a previous sibling who died 
- [[Meconium aspiration syndrome]]
