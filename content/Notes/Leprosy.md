	- Borderline tuberculoid (commonest)
	- Borderline (rarest)
	- Borderline lepromatous
3. Lepromatous
4. Indeterminate
	- Healing
	- Persistence
	- Deteriorate

### Neurological involvement in leprosy  
- Nerve involvement leads to nerve enlargement and peripheral nerve palsies which present with sensory, motor, and/or autonomic deficits.
- [[Ulnar nerve palsy]] is the commonest nerve involved
	- clawing of the fourth and fifth fingers, wasting of dorsal interosseous nerves, loss of sensation
- [[Facial nerve]] is the commonest cranial nerve
	- Blindness in leprosy due to [[Exposure keratitis]] due to [[Lagophthalmos]] 
- Peroneal nerve palsy: foot drop
- Posterior auricular nerve
- Posterior tibial nerve 
- Sensation loss: 
	1. Temperature (Cold --> Hot)
- Skin dryness: Secondary [[Ichthyosis]] and plantar ulcers
	- Clofazimine itself causes dryness of skin, further exacerbating the condition 

### Diagnostics
- Indeterminate
	- Peri appendageal and perineural lymphocytic infiltration
	- Paucibacillary
	- ROM regimen is obsolete
- Determinate
	- Grenz zone: clear dermal zone overlying the lesion seen in lepromatous leprosy because of inadequate immune cell collection
	- Satellite lesions are seen in BT
	- Punched out lesions/inverted saucer shaped/swiss cheese shaped or geographical lesions seen in BB

### Treatment in children ()
- Age 10-14
	- Rifampicin 450 mg/month
	- Dapsone 50 mg
	- Clofazimine (50 mg alternate day and 150 mg once a month)
- Weight < 40 kg
	- R: 10 mg/kg
	- D: 2 mg/kg
	- C: 6 mg/kg monthly and 1 mg/kg daily

### Complications
- [[Peripheral neuropathy]]
- Nasal: Saddle deformity, anosmia, [[Septal Perforations]]
- [[Anterior uveitis]]
- [[Orchitis]]
- [[Lepra reactions]] during treatment

### *Related
- [[Pitryiasis alba]] 
- Histoid leprosy
	- Nodules with normal appearing skin
	- Seen after [[Dapsone]] monotherapy
- Lazarine leprosy
	- LL type of leprosy seen in [[Protein energy malnutrition]] 
- Lucio leprosy/lepra Bonita
	- Beautiful leprosy?: Diffuse skin infiltration due to smooth, shiny, erythematous skin 
	- Seen in central americas
- Pure neuritic leprosy
	- only nerve involvement is seen, without skin involvement
	- Diagnosed using Nerve biopsy: sensory nerve preferable for e.g. Sural nerve, cut. branch of radial nerve
