- There are four types of tumors that are classified under periampullary tumors: 
	- Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas or of the distal pancreatic duct; 
	- Cholangiocarcinoma (of the distal CBD); 
	- Primary ampullary carcinoma (of the Ampulla of Vater); 
	- Adenocarcinoma of the 2nd part of the duodenum (most rare). 
- Primary ampullary carcinoma has the best prognostic and postoperative life-expectancy rates.

| Characteristic | Pancreatic Carcinoma                                                   | Periampullary Carcinoma                                                         |

| Location       | Arises from the pancreas tissue                                        | Located near the ampulla of Vater                                               |
| Anatomy        | Primarily affects the pancreas, often in the head                      | Originates from the ampulla of Vater or nearby structures (bile duct, duodenum) |
| GI bleeding    | Absent                                                                 | **Present**                                                                     |
| Prognosis      | Generally poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and aggressive behavior | Generally **better** prognosis, especially if diagnosed early and resectable    |
| Treatment      | Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy                    | Surgical resection (if resectable), chemotherapy, radiation therapy             |
