### Risk factors
- BMI > 25

- Abnormal OGTT
- Signs of [[Insulin resistance]]

- [[Elderly primigravida]] 

### Cause
- [[Insulin resistance]] due to hormonal changes

### Pathogenesis

### Diagnostics
| Aspect                | Early Pregnancy Testing                                                   | Late Pregnancy Testing                                                                                               |

| Targeted patients     | Targeted at individuals with risk factors for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes | Universal screening due to the high prevalence of risk factors                                                       |
| Timing                | Typically conducted at the initial prenatal visit                         | Patients with normal 75- or 100-gram oral GTT in early pregnancy are screened for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation |
| Screening Test        | Standard OGTT                                                             | One- or two-step approaches for glucose tolerance test                                                               |
| Diagnostic Criteria   | Normal diagnostic criteria for [[Diabetes Mellitus]] are used             | Criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes are used                                                                |
| Clinical Implications | Identifies patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes                  | Screens for gestational diabetes later in pregnancy                                                                  |
| Management            | Managed similarly to preexisting diabetes mellitus                        | Treatment based on guidelines for gestational diabetes                                                               |
| Routine Screening     | Conducted as part of routine prenatal laboratory studies                  | Part of universal screening at **24 to 28** weeks of gestation                                                       |

- One- vs 2-step screening was not significantly associated with improved health outcomes. At or after 24 weeks of gestation, treatment of gestational diabetes was significantly associated with improved health outcomes.
- 1 step approach using after fasting 75 gram OGTT: 92-180-153 (more than 1 abnormal test required)
- 2 step approach
	- Initial screening: Random 50 g 1-hour OGTT without fasting, > 135 in high risk and > 140 in low risk patients is considered abnormal
	- Confirmatory test: 100 gram 3-hour OGTT (2 or more abnormal results to make diagnosis)

### Management
- [[Gestational weight gain]] 
- [[Obstetric care]] 
- Glycemic control
	   - Dietary modifications and regular exercise (walking)
	   - Strict blood glucose monitoring (4x daily)
	   - Insulin therapy if glycemic control is insufficient with dietary modifications 
- Metformin and glyburide in patients who are unwilling or unable to use insulin
- Regular ultrasound to evaluate fetal development
- Consider inducing delivery at week 39–40, if glycemic control is poor or if complications occur

- [[Trial of labor]] 
### Complications
![[Pasted image 20240224201444.png]]
 - Increased risk of developing T2DM (up to 50% over 10 years)
    - Screen for DM 6–12 weeks postpartum (75 g 2-hour GTT)
    - Repeat every 3 years
- Increased risk of gestational diabetes recurring in subsequent pregnancies (∼ 50%)
