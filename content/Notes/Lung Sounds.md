- Amphoric breath sounds: A harsh, hollow breath sound with high-pitched overtones heard on lung auscultation. It is produced by air passing through a large, superficial cavity that communicates with the bronchial system (e.g., a cyst or abscess) and cannot be heard if there is fluid or a fungal ball within the cavity.
