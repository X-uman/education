### Definition
- **Clinico-pathological Entity:** Characterized by:
  - **Morphologically:** Destruction of renal tubular epithelial cells either due to ischemia or nephrotoxins, and [[coagulative necrosis]]
  - **Clinically:** usually reversible [[Acute Kidney Injury]] 
#### Types

| Type     | Ischemic                                                                                                   | Toxic                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Causes   | Decreased [[Renal perfusion]]                                                                              | [[Nephrotoxic agents]] |
| Sites    | Straight portion of PCT, ascending thick limb of LOH                                                       | PCT                    |
| Features | [[Tubulorrhexis]]<br> formation hyaline and granular casts<br> main component is [[Tamm-Horsfall protein]] |                        |

#### Pathogenesis
  1. **[[RAAS]]:** Decreased activity of vasodilators → Arteriolar vasoconstriction (Tubulo-glomerular feedback).
  2. **Tubular Injury:** Inflammatory mediators → Glomerular injury.
  3. **Tubular Epithelial Cell Injury:** Necrotic cells shed → Formation of casts and obstruction of lumen. (**Muddy brown urine casts**)
  4. **Back Leakage:** From tubules into interstitial space → Increased interstitial pressure.

#### Pathology
- **Ischemic ATN:**
  - **Characteristics:** Focal/patchy tubular epithelial necrosis. Some cells sloughed off, swollen, vacuolated.
  - **Common Sites:** . Blood supply is slow and less as we go deeper; metabolism in PCT and TALOH are high, so they are most susceptible to ischemia.
  - **Features:**  (rupture of tubular basement membrane), .
  - **Features:** Casts may be seen.
  - **Note:** Toxins have maximum injurious effect on proximal tubules.

#### Clinical Features
- **Three Phases:**

| Phase       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initiating  | - Lasts approximately 36 hours.<br>- Mild reduction in urine volume.<br>- BUN level begins to rise.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Maintenance | - Also known as the oliguric phase.<br>- Marked reduction in urine volume, leading to oliguria or anuria.<br>- Significant rise in BUN level.<br>- Elevated potassium levels ([[hyperkalemia]]).<br>- Metabolic acidosis due to [[renal tubular acidosis]], characterized by decreased H+ excretion and increased HCO3- excretion. |
| Recovery    | - Also known as the polyuric phase.<br>- Urine volume increases, sometimes leading to polyuria due to tubular dysfunction and lack of concentrating capacity of urine.<br>- Risk of [[hypokalemia]], as potassium is lost during this phase.                                                                                       |

### Prognosis of ATN
- **Good:** Especially in toxic type.
- **Poor:** Especially when due to shock.
