	- Total leukocyte count 10,000
- Rule of 10 for Cleft palate surgery
	- Weighs at least 10 kg
	- Has Hb of 10 gm/dl
	- At least 10 months old
	- TLC 10,000 
- Better results are obtained when the child is at least 3 months.
##### Operative Procedures for cleft lip
- Primary repair (cheiloplasty)
- Milliard Rotation advancement Technique
- Tennison-Randall Technique
- Mohler Technique
- Triangular flap Technique
- [[Z-plasty]] 
- Lip adhesion: Lip Reconstruction in 2 steps, Labioplasty under GA
##### Operational Procedures for Cleft Palate
- Palatal defect is closed in 3 layers
	- Nasal, muscle and oral layers.
- Oral muscles and Orthopedic Alveolar realignment
- Facial growth less affected if surgery delayed until 18-24 months
- Minimal Tension and Scarring on the palate
- Scarring may cause Impaired mid facial growth like Alveolar arch collapse, Mid face Retrusion and Malocclusion

### Rehabilitation
- Hearing Management: Reduced SNHL by hearing aid
- Articulation problems: Speech and language therapy
- [[Velopharyngeal incompetence]]: Intra-velar veloplasty and Pharyngoplasty
- Dental Problems: Orthodontic treatment

### Non-surgical managements
- Lip Adhesions
- Dental Obturator for patients that refuse or are at high risk of surgery, high rate of Closure, but need to wear prosthesis
