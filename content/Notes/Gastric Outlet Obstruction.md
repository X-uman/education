### Overview
- mechanical obstruction of the distal stomach, pyloric channel, or duodenum
### Etiology
- Malignancy (most  common)
- Intrinsic lumen reduction
	   - [[Gastric Carcinoma]]
	   - [[Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis]] 
	   - [[Peptic ulcer disease]]
- Extrinsic compression
	   - [[Pancreatic carcinoma]]
	   - [[Biliary carcinoma]] 
- Other: [[gastric volvulus]], strictures, foreign bodies

### Clinical features
- Postprandial, nonbilious projectile [[Vomiting]] 
- Early satiety
- Weight loss
- Progressive abdominal dilation
- Left to right peristalsis
- **Succussion splash**: 
	- a splashing sound created by the movement of gastric contents 
	   - Physiological if present immediately after a meal
	   - **Pathological if present after â‰¥ 3 hours of last food** which implies food has not passed distally 

### Diagnostics
- UGI series 
	- Duodenal cap
	- Trifoliate deformity: Deformed duodenal bulb 
	- [[Triradiate sign.png]] due to duodenal scarring
- CT or MRI abdomen
- confirmatory: [[UGI endoscopy]] 
- Laboratory studies (supportive): hypokalemic hypochloremic [[metabolic alkalosis]] due to repeated vomiting and loss of Hydrogen ions 
- Saline load test

### Definitive treatment
- Give [[Fluids]]: [[Normal saline]] + Inj. KCl 
- Treat the underlying cause (e.g., [[Anti H. pylori therapy]] ).
- Relieve the obstruction.
	   - Endoscopic stent placement
	   - Surgical options: gastrectomy, gastrojejunostomy 
	   - [[Gastric drainage procedures]] 

### Management for patients with DU
- Antretectomy/distal [[Gastrectomy]] combined with [[Vagotomy]] 
	- With the pylorus removed, alkaline intestinal contents bathing the stomach stimulate acid secretion, which can be suppressed by either lifelong anti-secretory therapy or vagotomy.
- [[Vagotomy]] + [[Gastric drainage procedures]]
