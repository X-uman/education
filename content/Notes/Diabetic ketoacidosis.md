### Introduction
| Clinical points                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| DKA usually evolves rapidly over a 24-hour period.                                                                                                                                                              |
| The earliest symptoms of marked hyperglycemia are polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss due to dehydration. Common, early signs of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hyperventilation. |
| As hyperglycemia worsens, neurologic symptoms appear and may progress to include lethargy, focal deficits, obtundation, seizure, and coma.                                                                      |
| Common causes of DKA include: infection; noncompliance, inappropriate adjustment, or cessation of insulin; new-onset diabetes mellitus; and myocardial ischemia.                                                |
### Diagnosis of DKA
- Diabetic ketoacidosis i.e.
	- uncontrolled diabetes (> 200 mg/dl)
	- Ketosis (>=3 m0ml/L) blood or 
	- ketones can be demonstrated in urine 2+ or more
	- [[Metabolic acidosis]]  
		- pH < 7.30) with increased anion gap > 10 mmol/L

### Assessment of dehydration in children 

| Criteria                                   | Assumed Dehydration (%) | Body Weight Adjustment                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| New onset of diabetes, pH <7.1, or BUN >20 | 8                       | Not specified                         |
| All other children                         | 6                       | Not specified                         |
| Children with obesity                      | Not specified           | Use actual body weight (up to 100 kg) |

### Pathogenesis

### Diagnostics
- [[DKA vs HHS]] 
- Urine acetoacetate (ketonuria) may persist for some time after resolution of DKA and should not be considered an indication of persistent ketoacidosis.
- Venous pH is the most accurate measure of acidosis in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. However, measurements of serum bicarbonate may be used alone, especially in resource-limited settings, and are closely correlated with venous pH.
#### Severity of DKA
| Severity                  | pH          | Bicarbonate (mEq/L) |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Mild                      | 7.2 to <7.3 | 10 to <18           |
| Moderate                  | 7.1 to <7.2 | 5 to 9              |
| Severe                    | <7.1        | <5                  |
| Indication of bicarbonate | < 6.9       |                     |

### Principles of management
#### 1. Fluid management
| **Treatment Phase**                                         | **IV Fluid Solution**                                                                                                                | **Dosage**                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| First hour                                                  | Isotonic saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride)                                                                                      | 15–20 mL/kg/hour (∼ 1000–1500 mL bolus) |
| Next 24–48 hours                                            | Adjust IV fluid rate and composition according to central venous pressure, urine output, blood glucose, and corrected sodium levels. |                                         |
| Check corrected sodium for hyperglycemia.                   | If corrected serum sodium ≥ 135 mmol/L:                                                                                              | 0.45% NaCl                              |
|                                                             | If corrected serum sodium < 135 mmol/L:                                                                                              | 0.9% NaCl                               |
| when glucose falls to ∼ 200 mg/dL (DKA) or 300 mg/dL (HHS). | Switch to a solution containing dextrose (e.g., D5NS)                                                                                |                                         |

#### 2. Manage Potassium

### Complications
| Complications                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mortality                    | - Reported mortality rates for DKA range from 0.15 to 0.31 percent in developed countries, with cerebral injury accounting for the majority of deaths (60 to 90 percent). Mortality is substantially higher in resource-limited settings.                                                                     |
| Cerebral injury              | - Occurs in 0.3 to 0.9 percent of children with DKA and has a high mortality rate of 21 to 24 percent. Greatest risk in children with severe acidosis and/or severe dehydration. Development typically within the first 12 hours of treatment.                                                                |
| Cognitive impairment         | - DKA may be associated with subtle neurocognitive dysfunction after recovery, including alterations in memory, attention, and IQ. Changes in cerebral microstructure have been detected in children with a history of DKA.                                                                                   |
| [[Venous thrombosis]]        | - Increased risk, particularly with femoral central venous catheter placement. Possibly due to a prothrombotic state associated with DKA.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Pancreatic enzyme elevations | - Mild elevations in serum amylase and lipase seen in approximately 40 percent of children with DKA. Not indicative of acute pancreatitis in most cases. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be confirmed by computed tomography scan.                                                                     |
| Acute kidney injury (AKI)    | - High frequency observed in children with DKA (approximately 50 percent). Many have stage 2 or 3 AKI, suggesting intrinsic tubular injury. Renal function generally returns to normal post-recovery, but DKA-related AKI increases long-term risk of diabetic kidney disease.                                |
| Other complications          | - Includes cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, intestinal necrosis, acute pancreatitis, and susceptibility to rhinocerebral or pulmonary mucormycosis, a rare and often fatal fungal infection occurring most commonly in patients with chronic poor glycemic control. |
