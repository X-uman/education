### Clinical presentation  
- MC site: lower limb
- M > F
- 
##### Triad
- Swelling (Painless) due to some anesthetic substances produced by the organisms.
- Sinuses
- Sulphur granules

- Involvement of muscles and bones makes the disease more resistant to treatment and may present as osteomyelitis also
- enlarged regional lymph node is most commonly a result of secondary bacterial infection
- the genuine lymphatic spread of mycetoma may also occur and sporotrichosis-like lesions along lymphatics have been reported
- Metastatic lesions can occur at distant lymph nodes which are seen more commonly in actinomycetoma
#### Clinical signs
- Color of granules
	- Yellow, brown to black colored
- sometimes a soft and lobulated or rarely a cystic swelling may be seen.
- Alternating phases of disease activity and healing lead to the presence of fresh as well as healed sinuses at the same time, which is very characteristic for mycetoma
- The overlying skin becomes smooth, stretched, and shiny with areas of hypo- or hyper-pigmentation and is fixed to the underlying structures.
- Rarely, there may be an increase in sweating and raised local temperature over the lesion which is probably due to sweat gland hyperplasia and increased vascularity due to inflammation, respectively
- **black/dark grains are always diagnostic of eumycetoma, while red/pink grains are diagnostic of actinomycetoma**
- Usually, the grains are soft, but those due to Scedosporium somaliensis and Madurella mycetomatis can be quite hard.

### Diagnostics


---
### Management
- systemic antimicrobials along with [[Cytoreductive surgery]] of the larger lesions
- Causative agents of mycetoma belong to two different families with completely different therapies, confirmation of the diagnosis is essential

##### Actinomycetoma 
- co-trimoxazole (TMP-SMX) forms an integral part of actinomycetoma management
- In non-responders or those with allergies to the combination, TMP-SMX can be replaced by amoxicillin-clavulanate or carbapenems such as imipenem or meropenem and amikacin can be replaced by netilmicin
- During pregnancy, monotherapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate is considered to be the safest option.

##### Eumycetoma
- Surgical debulking forms an essential part of the treatment for eumycetoma due to poor drug penetration through the fibrous encasement of the lesion.
- It reduces the mycetoma load and provides a better response to clinical therapy.
- surgical dissection with appropriate safety margin 
- followed by a thorough examination of all the cavities and deep pockets of the damaged tissues and its systematic irrigation with iodine solution and hydrogen peroxide is necessary to destroy hyphae and grains that have been left behind
- Itraconazole (400 mg/day) in 2 divided doses is considered to be the gold standard therapy
##### Endpoint of Treatment
Certain parameters can be looked upon to evaluate clinical cure in a case of mycetoma like: 
- Normal appearance of overlying skin.
- The disappearance of swelling along with healing of sinuses.
- FNAC of the tissue showing clearance of organism and its grains.
- Ultrasonographical examination demonstrating an absence of grains and cavities.
- Radiological examination exhibiting reappearance of normal bone pattern and absence of soft tissue swelling.
