| Aspect              | Details                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Indications         | Approved for patients with specific CFTR mutations (e.g., Î”F508, G551D mutations)                                                                                  |
| Mechanism of Action | - Improve CFTR protein function by targeting underlying protein defects                                                                                            |
|                     | - Potentiators (e.g., ivacaftor): Increase CFTR Cl- channel gate opening and conductance, improving Cl- transport                                                  |
|                     | - Correctors (e.g., lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor): Improve protein folding, protein stability, and transport of functional CFTR protein to the cell surface |
| Combination Therapy | - Two or more CFTR modulators with different mechanisms of action can be combined to synergistically improve CFTR protein quantity and function                    |
|                     | - E.g., elexacaftor has an alternate CFTR protein binding site to tezacaftor, allowing them to be used in combination                                              |
|                     | - Combination therapy increases the yield of CFTR modulators, benefiting larger numbers of patients                                                                |
| Genetic Testing     | Perform CFTR genetic testing in all patients diagnosed with CF to assess for specific mutations that can be targeted by CFTR modulators                            |
| Benefits            | - Improve FEV1                                                                                                                                                     |
|                     | - Help patients with [[Failure to thrive]]                                                                                                                         |
|                     | - Reduce exacerbations                                                                                                                                             |
|                     | - Decrease sweat Cl- concentration                                                                                                                                 |
