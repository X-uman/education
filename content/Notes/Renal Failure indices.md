- The low tubular flow rate and increased renal medullary recycling of [[urea]] seen in prerenal azotemia may cause a disproportionate elevation of the BUN compared to creatinine.  
- Other causes of disproportionate [[BUN elevation]] need to be kept in mind

- With prerenal azotemia, the FeNa may be <1%, suggesting avid tubular sodium reabsorption. Low FeNa is often seen early in glomerulonephritis and other disorders and, hence, should not be taken as prima facie evidence of prerenal azotemia. 
- Low FeNa is therefore suggestive, but not synonymous, with effective intravascular volume depletion, and should not be used as the sole guide for volume management.  As such, it depends on sodium intake, effective intravascular volume, GFR, diuretic intake, and intact tubular reabsorptive mechanisms.  
- The FeNa may also be >1% despite [[hypovolemia]] due to treatment with [[diuretics]].

- The response of urine output to crystalloid or colloid fluid administration may be both diagnostic and therapeutic in prerenal azotemia.

- In ischemic AKI, the FeNa is frequently >1% because of tubular injury and resultant inability to reabsorb sodium. 

- Several causes of ischemia-associated and nephrotoxin-associated AKI can present with FeNa <1%, however, including sepsis (often early in the course), rhabdomyolysis, and contrast nephropathy.

- In the patient not taking diuretics and with good baseline kidney function, urine osmolality may be >500 mOsm/kg in prerenal azotemia, consistent with an intact [[medullary concentration gradient]] and elevated serum [[ADH]] levels causing water reabsorption resulting in concentrated urine. 

- In elderly patients and those with CKD, however, baseline concentrating defects may exist, making urinary osmolality unreliable in many instances. Loss of concentrating ability is common in most forms of AKI that affect the tubules and Interstitium, resulting in urine osmolality <350 mOsm/kg, but the finding is not specific.
