### risk factors
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]] 
- [ ] [[Gestational diabetes mellitus]]: leads to ↑ fetal insulin, which inhibits surfactant synthesis #todo 
- Hereditary
- [[Cesarean Section]]: results in lower levels of fetal glucocorticoids than vaginal delivery, in which higher levels are released as a response to stress from uterine contractions
- [[Hydrops fetalis]]
- [[multiple gestation]] 
- Male sex

### Basics
- [[Lung compliance]]
- [[Lung surfactants]]
- [[Atelectasis]] 

## Pathophysiology
- Little or no reduction of alveolar surface tension → increased alveolar collapse → [[atelectasis]] → decreased [[lung compliance]] and [[functional residual capacity]] → [[hypoxemia]] and [[hypercapnia]]
- Hypoxemia and hypercapnia → vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vessels (hypoxic vasoconstriction) and respiratory acidosis → intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt → increased permeability due to alveolar epithelial damage → fibrinous exudation within the alveoli → development of hyaline membranes in the lungs (hyaline membrane disease)

## Presentation
 - Onset of symptoms: usually immediately after birth but can occur up to 72 hours postpartum 
 - Signs of [[Respiratory failure]] 

## Complications #todo  
- [ ] [[Pneumothorax]] 
- [ ] [[Patent ductus arteriosus]] (the persistently low partial pressure of oxygen in the blood contributes to PDA)
- [ ] [[necrotizing enterocolitis]]
- [ ] [[Intraventricular hemorrhage]] 
- [ ] [[Cardiac arrest]] 
- [ ] [[Neonatal sepsis]]
- [ ] [[oxygen toxicity]] 

## investigations
- [[Chest X-ray]]
	- [[Ground glass opacity]]
	- [[Air bronchograms]]
	- Reduced [[Lung volumes]] 
- [[Lecithin: Sphingomyelin Ratio]] < 1.5 
- Foam stability index < 0.48
- **Histological findings:** 
	- Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli composed of fibrin, cellular debris, and [[RBC]] 
    - Eosinophilic appearance, amorphous material lining the alveolar surface
	- Engorged and congested capillary vessels in the Interstitium


## Management
- [[Supportive measures]]
- [[Neonatal resuscitation]] 
- [[PEEP]] by [[CPAP]] or [[Mechanical Ventilation]] 
- [[Surfactant therapy]] 
- [[Fetal lung maturity]] 
## Differential diagnoses 
 - [[Pulmonary hypoplasia]]

- [ ] [[Congenital diaphragmatic hernias]]
- [ ] [[Pneumothorax]]
- [ ] [[Neonatal pneumonia ]]
- [ ] Apnea of prematurity (AOP)
- [ ] Transient tachypnea of the newborn (wet lung disease) [8] 
- [ ] Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
- [ ] [[Meconium aspiration syndrome]] have similar X-ray features as [[oxygen toxicity]] or [[barotrauma]] 
- [ ]  hemolytic disease of the newborn
- [ ] [[Congenital Heart disease]] 
- [ ] bronchogenic cysts
