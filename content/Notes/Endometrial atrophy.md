### Etiology
- [[hypoestrogenism]] 
### Pathogenesis
- In the uterus, the collapsed atrophic endometrial surfaces contain little or no fluid to prevent intracavitary friction
- This results in micro-erosions of the surface epithelium and a subsequent chronic inflammatory reaction (chronic endometritis), which is prone to light bleeding or spotting
