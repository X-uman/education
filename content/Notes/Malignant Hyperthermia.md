### Etiology
- Inherited susceptibility: primarily autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance
    - Most cases are associated with a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR-1) 
    - or mutations in the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR)
    - Some cases (< 10%) are due to a spontaneous mutation. 
- Triggering agents
    - Volatile anesthetics (e.g., isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, halothane; except nitrous oxide)
    - Succinylcholine

### Pathophysiology
- Uncontrolled [[Muscle contraction]] 
- Leading to [[Hypermetabolism]] 
- [[Lactic acidosis]]
- [[Hypercapnia]]
- [[Rhabdomyolysis]] 

### Presentation
- More common in females
- Early signs
	- Difficulty opening mouth during administration of  [[Inducing Agents]] 
	- Tachycardia, tachypnea, cyanosis
- Late signs
	- [[Hyperthermia]]
	- Organ damage
		- [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
		- [[AKI.canvas|AKI]]
		- Seizures
		- [[Arrhythmias]]

### Diagnostics
- Diagnosis is generally clinical, based on intraoperative signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle and jaw rigidity, hyperthermia) in connection with increased end-tidal CO2 and signs of muscle breakdown. 
- Patients with a positive family history, suspicious clinical history, or masseter muscle rigidity should receive confirmatory preoperative testing to rule out the risk of MH.
- **Preoperative**
	- [[caffeine-halothane contracture test]]
	- Genetic testing: low sensitivity but highly specific and less expensive and invasive
- **Intraoperative**
	-  Respiratory parameters: continuous increase in end-tidal CO2
	- Blood tests
		- Arterial blood gas: ↑ pCO2, ↓ pO2, and ↑ lactate (mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis)
		- Electrolyte abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia 
		- Myoglobinemia, ↑ creatine kinase
		- Urine: myoglobinuria 

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Thyrotoxic crisis]]
- [[Pheochromocytoma]]
- Acute [[Porphyrias]] crisis
- [[levodopa]] withdrawal syndrome
- [[sepsis]] 

### Treatment
- Discontinue potential triggering agents
- [[Dantrolene]]
- Cooling measures
- Increase [[Minute ventilation]] 
- If adequately treated, the mortality rate is < 10%. In the absence of rapid, appropriate treatment, the mortality rate is ∼ 70%.
