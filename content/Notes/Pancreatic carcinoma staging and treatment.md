### Treatment
- Determine whether patient is operable or not
- Determine whether tumor is resectable or not 
	- Resectable: Usually if there is no contact between the tumor and mesenteric, celiac, or hepatic blood vessels on imaging.
	- Borderline Resectable: Usually if there is contact between the tumor and surrounding vessels, but without involvement of the celiac axis.
	- Unresectable locally advanced: Usually if there is significant involvement of local vasculature

| Resectability | Treatment approach                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Resectable    | Surgical resection f/o Adjuvant chemotherapy |
| Borderline    | Neoadjuvant therapy f/o surgical resection   |
| Unresectable  | Combination chemotherapy                     |
| Metastatic    | Combination chemotherapy                     |
### Procedures

| Procedure                                    | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Whipple operation]]                        | Extensive resection involving removal of the pancreatic head, distal stomach, duodenum, gallbladder, and common bile duct. |
| Traverso-Longmire procedure                  | Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, retaining the pylorus to preserve gastric function.                            |
| Pancreatic body and tail carcinoma resection | Resection of the left side of the pancreas, often involving splenectomy.                                                   |

| Therapy     | Indication                                                                                                                | Regimen                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Neoadjuvant | Considered in patients with a high likelihood of metastatic disease or margin-positive resection to improve resectability | Usually FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based regimens, although no clear consensus exists |
| Adjuvant    | All patients following surgical resection who did not receive preoperative treatment to increase long term survival       | Up to 6 months of chemotherapy (e.g., mFOLFIRINOX) with or without chemoradiation    |

### Supportive treatment
- [[Pain management]]
- Radiotherapy for brain and bone metastases
- [[Surgical Nutrition]] for Cachexia
	- [[Appetite stimulants]] 

#### Follow up
- Follow-up frequency: every 3–6 months for 2 years, then every 6–12 months
- Follow-up evaluation
	- Patient history and physical examination
	- CA 19-9 levels if elevated at baseline
	- Cross-sectional abdominal imaging (e.g., CT abdomen)
