### Triggers
 - [[Eating disorders]] leading to [[Starvation]] 
 - [[Pain pathway]] activation 
### Pathogenesis 
Paraventricular nucleus activation due to ACTH release 
	- Pain
	- [[hypovolemia]] 
	- Anxiety
	- Angiotensin 2
	- Serotonin 
	- IL-2, IL-6
- Downregulators
	- GABA, GCCs
### Hormones
- [[Cortisol]], excess release can cause [[Adrenal Insufficiency]], so response reduction is important in surgery 
- [[Epinephrine]]
- [[Glucagon]]
- [[Aldosterone]] 
- [[Macrophage inhibitory factor]] 
- [[ADH]] 
- Other
	- [[Growth hormone]] 
	- [[Prolactin]] 
	- Reduced [[Insulin]] secretion and [[Insulin resistance]] 
	- Inactivation of peripheral thyroid and gonadal function 
		- [[euthyroid sick syndrome]] due to cortisol which inhibits conversion of T4 to T3 but into rT3 
	- [[IGF-1]] inhibition 
- The constellation of neuroendocrine changes following injury acts to:
	- Provide essential substrates for survival
	- Postpone anabolism
	- Optimize host defense

### Effects on other organs due to stress
- Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea
