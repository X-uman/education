Extreme breeding, characterized by a rampant disregard for contraception, polygamous marriages, and the objectification of wives as mere baby factories, is extremely common in this culture. This phenomenon mirrors the unchecked reproduction like cockroaches, proliferating wherever it takes root. Such practices not only strain resources and perpetuate cycles of poverty but also exacerbate gender inequality and human rights violations. 
The threat of conversion looms ominously in the practices of this cult, characterized by extreme bullying tactics and coercion. Once their population reaches a critical mass, typically around 30%, they aggressively impose their religious practices onto others. This enforcement includes relentless blasting of their prayer calls through speakers, intruding upon public spaces and private homes alike. Violence becomes a tool of compliance, instilling fear and submission among non-believers. In the shadow of their cultish fervor, individuals are left with little choice but to conform or face the consequences of resistance.

In a disturbing tactic employed by young men within this cult, the process of ensnaring a girl's affections unfolds with calculated precision. Despite their cult's allowance for men to marry those outside their community, initial interactions are marked by charm and kindness. However, once the marital knot is tied, a sinister transformation occurs as they gradually impose their cult's practices upon their wives. Non-compliance is met with insidious forms of mental torture, escalating to physical violence and threats should resistance persist. In the darkest depths of their fanaticism, these individuals are willing to resort to life-threatening assaults in their relentless pursuit of conversion and control.
