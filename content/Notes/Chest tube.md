- Procedure
	- Most commonly in the 4thâ€“5th intercostal space (nipple line), between the anterior and midaxillary line (safe triangle )
	- The chest drainage system may be used with or without suction.  
	- Always check CXR after the procedure is complete. 

#### Safe triangle
- 2 vertices
	- Lateral border of Pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi
	- inferiorly, by a horizontal line from the nipple (commonly the 5th intercostal space)
- There have been cases reported of complications from ICC placement even when using these landmarks, with authors advising the supplementary use of ultrasound visualization
- As with all intercostal approaches, placing the catheter closer to the superior border of the rib below in the intercostal space should avoid injury to the intercostal neurovascular bundle under the costal groove of the rib above.
