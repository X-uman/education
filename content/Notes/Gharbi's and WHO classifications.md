| CE 1 (Active Stage)          | - Unilocular anechoic cystic lesion<br>- No internal echoes or septations<br>- Uniformly anechoic cyst with fine internal echoes may only be visible after patient repositioning<br>- Internal echoes represent "hydatid sand" (fluid and protoscolices originating from a ruptured vesicle) |
| CE 2 (Active Stage)          | - Cyst with internal septation<br>- Septa represent walls of daughter cyst(s)<br>- Described as multivesicular, rosette, or honeycomb appearance                                                                                                                                             |
| CE 3 (Transitional Stage)    | - The evolving appearance of daughter cyst(s) within the encompassing parent cyst<br>- 3A: Daughter cysts have detached laminated membranes (water lily sign)<br>- 3B: Daughter cysts within a solid matrix                                                                                  |
| CE 4 (Inactive/Degenerative) | - Absence of daughter cysts<br>- Mixed hypoechoic and hyperechoic matrix, resembling a ball of wool (ball of wool sign)                                                                                                                                                                      |
