- Titubation is seen in cerebellar disease and describes a staggering gait and a tremor of the head and torso. 
- Poor postural control
- Imbalance
- Loss of muscle coordination
- loss of muscle tone: Due to lack of static Gamma motor neuron activity 
- [[gait & Ataxia]] abnormalities 
- Charcot triad
	- Scanning speech ([[dysarthria]])
	- [[Nystagmus]]
	- Intention [[Tremors]] : 
		- < 5 Hz tremors occurring during a goal directed movement
		- Unlike [[Parkinsonism]], they are absent at rest 
- [[Pronator drift test]]: Pronation and upward drift vs [[UMN Lesions]] 
- Dysdiadochokinesis 
- Decomposition of movement: Inability to perform actions that involve simultaneous motion of >1 joint. the patient dissects such movements and carries out one joint at a time 
- Flocculo-nodular lobe lesions: Child is afraid and reluctant to stand erect and move without support, because if he tries to walk, he does so in staggering fashion on a broad base and tends to fall

Cerebellar Lesions

##### Dysmetria and Ataxia
- In absence of Cerebellum, subconscious motor control system cannot predict how far movement will go
- Therefore the movements overshoot their intended mark, then the conscious portion of the brain overcompensates in the opposite direction for the succeeding compensatory movements. This effect is called Dysmetria and it results in uncoordinated movements that are called Ataxia
- Dysmetria and Ataxia can also result from lesion in [[spinocerebellar tracts]] because the feedback information from the moving parts of the body to the body to cerebellum is essential for cerebellar timing of movement termination

##### Past Pointing
- It means in the absence of cerebellum, the person ordinarily moves the hands or some other moving part of the body considerably beyond the point of intention
- It results from the fact that normally the cerebellum initiates most of the motor signals that turn off a movement after it is begun. If the cerebellum is not available to initiate this motor signal, the movement ordinarily goes beyond the intended mark.
- Therefore past pointing is actually a manifestation of Dysmetria


##### Failure of Progression

- Dysdiadochokinesia–Inability to perform rapid alternating movements
	- It occurs from the failure of motor control system to predict where the different part of body will be at a given time
	- Results in loss of perception of parts during rapid movements, so the succeeding movement may begin too early or much too late, so no orderly Progression of movement can occur
	- It can be demonstrated by having a patient with cerebellar damage turn one hand upward and downward at rapid rate. The patient looses all perception of the instantaneous position of hand during any portion of the movement. As a result a series of stalled attempted but jumbled movements occur instead of Normal coordinated Upward and Downward Movements

- Dysarthria–Failure of progression in talking
	- Formation of words depends on rapid and orderly succession of individual muscle movements in Larynx, Mouth and Respiratory system
	- Lack of coordination among these structures and inability to adjust in advance either the intensity of sound or duration of each successive sound causes jumbled vocalization, with some syllables loud, some weak, some held for short intervals and some held for short intervals, with the resultant speech that is often unintelligible

- Intention Tremor
	- When a person with lost cerebellum performs a voluntary movement, the movement tend to oscillate, especially when they approach the intended mark, first overshooting the mark and then vibrating back and fort several times before settling on the mark–This reaction is called Intention tremor or an Action Tremor
	- It results from cerebellar overshooting and failure of the cerebellar system to Damp the motor movements

- Cerebellar Nystagmus–Tremor of the eyeballs
	- Occurs when one attempts to fixate the eyes on a scene to one side of the head
	- This off-center type of Fixation results in rapid, tremulous movements of the eyes rather than steady fixation, and it is manifestation of the failure of the Damping by the cerebellum
	- It occurs especially when Floculonodular lobes of Cerebellum are damaged, in this instance it is also associated with loss of equilibrium because of dysfunction of the pathways through the Floculonodular cerebellum from the Semicircular canals

- [[Hypotonia]]–Decreased tone of the musculature
	- Loss of deep cerebellar nuclei, particularly of the dentate and Interposed nuclei, causes decreased tone of the peripheral body musculature on the side of cerebellar Lesion
	- Results from loss of cerebellar facilitation of the motor cortex and brain stem motor nuclei by tonic signals from deep cerebellar nuclei

The clinical features vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of cerebellar injury. Symptoms manifest ipsilaterally to the site of the lesion.

- [[Cerebellar ataxia]]
- Tremor (postural, action, intention tremor): patients with tremor perform the finger-to-nose test with shaking fingers
- Dysdiadochokinesia
    - Inability to perform rapidly alternating agonistic-antagonistic movements
    - Positive rapid alternating movement test: the patient is unable to rapidly screw in an imaginary large light bulb using both hands (slow, uncoordinated movements)

- Rebound phenomenon (Stewart-Holmes sign)
    - The patient is asked to flex their elbow against resistance applied by the examiner pulling the forearm in the opposite direction; sudden release of the arm by the examiner results in an overshooting movement. 

- Pendular knee jerk
    - Abnormally increased patellar reflex
    - Leg movement persists beyond initial reflex triggering

- Cerebellar drift: the patient is asked to extend their supinated arms at shoulder level; the arm ipsilateral to the lesion will pronate and drift upwards.
- Dysarthria (scanning speech): words are broken down into separate syllables and spoken with varying force
- Oculomotor dysfunction (including nystagmus)
- Acute cerebellar hemorrhage
    - Occipital headache
    - Neck stiffness
    - Vomiting
    - Nystagmus
    - Gait ataxia

- Other
    - Vertigo 
    - Muscular hypotonia
