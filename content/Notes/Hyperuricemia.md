### Primary hyperuricemia
- Idiopathic extracellular supersaturation of uric acid
- No history of comorbidities or medications that affect uric acid formation or excretion
- Primary hyperuricemia can be aggravated by poor dietary habits.

### Secondary hyperuricemia

##### - Decreased uric acid excretion: most common cause
   - Medications (e.g., [[pyrazinamide]], [[aspirin]], [[loop diuretics]], [[thiazides]], [[niacin]])
   - [[CKD]] , lead nephropathy
   - [[Ketoacidosis]] (due to, e.g., starvation, diabetes mellitus) 
   - lactic acidosis (Competes for excretion)
   - Post-menopause: withdrawal of uricosuric effect of [[Estrogen]] 
##### - Increased uric acid production
- High cell turnover, e.g.:
	- [[Tumor lysis syndrome]]
	- [[hemolytic anemia]] due to destruction of nucleated [[Reticulocytes]] 
	- [[Psoriasis]]
	- Myeloproliferative neoplasms
	- Chemotherapy, radiation
- Enzyme defects,
    - [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]]
    - Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase overactivity
    - [[von Gierke disease]]
- Diet rich in protein and especially purine (e.g., red meat, seafood)
- Obesity
- Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia
- [[Hypertension]]
- Sleep apnea, Hyperuricemia occurs due to Hypoxia and Acidosis 
- Combined decreased excretion and overproduction: high alcohol consumption
    - Organic acids from alcohol metabolism compete with uric acid to be excreted by the kidneys.
    - Many alcoholic beverages contain a high level of purines

### Diagnostics
- 24 hour urate excretion: 
	- To estimate risk for renal stones, normally excretion is less than 800
	- Not routine recommended unless Early Onset (< 25 y) or family history or Renal stones 

### Complications
- Nephrolithiasis: uric acid stones
- [[Uric acid nephropathy]]
