### Clinical implications 
- The majority of the growth of a tumor occurs before it is clinically detectable
- By the time they are detected, tumors have passed the period of most rapid growth, that period when they might be most sensitive to anti-proliferative drugs
- There has been plenty of time, before diagnosis, for individual cells to detach, invade, implant and form distant metastases
- ‘Early tumors’ are genetically old: plenty of time for mutations to have occurred, mutations that might confer spontaneous drug resistance (a probability greatly increased by the existence of cell loss)
- The rate of regression of a tumour will depend upon its age (the Norton–Simon hypothesis extends this: the rate of regression of a tumour will depend upon its growth rate at the time of treatment)
