#### Outside skull
The facial nerve after entering the parotid gland splits into two main branches, the temporofacial and cervicofacial branches. 
This bifurcation is known as the Pes anserinus (Gooseâ€™s foot) and divides to give rise to five other branches. The five branches exit from the anterior aspect of the parotid gland. 

#### Branches
These are temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular and the cervical branch. 
Temporal, zygomatic and buccal arise from the temporofacial branch, the other two from the cervicofacial branch.
