- Buserelin
- Goserelin

### Mechanism
- Continued stimulation of the receptor leads to desensitization of the [[pituitary gland]], thereby reducing the secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and decreasing [[estrogen]] in females and [[testosterone]] in males. 
- Cause medical oophorectomy i.e. leads to 
	- [[hypoestrogenism]]
	- [[Amenorrhea]] 
- Used to treat hormonally-sensitive cancers, to delay puberty in patients with [[precocious puberty]], and to induce a hypoestrogenic state in women with [[menorrhagia]], [[endometriosis]], or uterine fibroids.
- To avoid hypoestrogenic side effects, GnRH agonists are administered together with estrogen-progestin OCPs.
