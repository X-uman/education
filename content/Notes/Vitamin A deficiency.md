### Etiology
- Inadequate intake
- [[Malabsorption syndrome]]

### Pathophysiology

| Form                               | Function                                                                                                      | Deficiency                                                                             |

| 11-cis-retinal                     | [[Dark adaptation]]                                                                                           | Night blindness                                                                        |
| [[All-trans retinoic acid]] (ATRA) | cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, reproduction (e.g., spermatogenesis), and embryonic development | metaplasia of squamous cells like [[Bitot spot]], Xerosis cutis, follicular keratosis  |
| Retinol                            | [[Anti-oxidants]]                                                                                             |                                                                                        |


### Clinical features
- Ocular manifestations
	- First sign: Delayed [[Dark adaptation]] 
	- Night blindness (nyctalopia)
	- Xerophthalmia
	- Keratomalacia
	- Bitot's spots: gray, triangular, dry patches on the bulbar conjunctiva, covered by a layer with a foamy appearance
	- [[Xerophthalmia classification.png]] 
- Typical sign of vitamin A deficiency
	- Caused by squamous cell metaplasia and keratinization of the conjunctiva
	- Keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the bladder (pearl-like plaques on cystoscopy)
	- Xerosis cutis
	- Follicular keratosis
	- Acneiform lesions
- [[immunocompromised status]] 

### Therapeutic considerations 
- Contraindicated in pregnancy, causes [[microphthalmia]], [[Cleft lip & palate]] and CVS abnormalities 
- Contraception before prescribing [[Isotretinoin]] in women
- Recommended in [[Measles]], reduces complications & mortality in deficient states
- Used in Severe cystic [[Acne vulgaris]] and [[Acne rosacea]] 
- Topical form used in Mild Acne
- [[Acute promyelocytic leukemia]]: All-trans retinoic acid

### Vitamin A replacement
- Routine supplementation no longer recommended for neonates, infants one to five months of age, or to mothers during the postpartum period living in endemic areas
#### Targeted supplementation 
- For children at high risk of vitamin A deficiency, such as those with [[measles]], diarrhea, respiratory disease, or severe malnutrition, who live among populations at risk for vitamin A deficiency, and who have not received supplements within the past one to four months, the WHO recommends an (additional) one-time vitamin A supplementation at the following age-specific doses 

|Age Group|Dosage (international units)|
|---|---|
|Infants < 6 months|50,000|
|Infants 6 to 12 months|100,000|
|Children >12 months|200,000|
