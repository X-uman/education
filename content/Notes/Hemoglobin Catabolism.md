- [[defects of metabolism]]
- Increased Hemolysis= Increased Unconjugated bilirubin production leading to jaundice 
- Hemoglobin= Heme + Globin (Protein) inside macrophage of spleen
	- Globin can be broken into individual amino acids and recycled to form other proteins
- Heme = Iron + ==Biliverdin== (Waste product) + [[Carbon Monoxide]] 
	- **Iron stored as Hemosiderin and Ferritin , [[Iron deficiency anemia]] 
		- Even if iron goes into blood, it is not free, it is b 
	- **Biliverdin converted into Bilirubin (Water insoluble)
	- **Bilirubin + ==Albumin== 
	- Unconjugated Bilirubin + ==UDP Glucouronide== = Conjugated Bilirubin (made Water soluble)
	- Conjugated bilirubin secreted into [[Bile]] and thrown into small intestine [[Hepatobiliary tract]]
	- Excreted into the feces as Stercobilin which is an Yellow Pigment
	- In Obstruction of Hepatobiliary tract i.e. [[Obstructive jaundice]], Bilirubin cannot go into Small intestine, so it is spilled into blood: Which causes Yellowing of body as it can go out from urine, so urine becomes excessively yellow [[Urobilinogen]]
