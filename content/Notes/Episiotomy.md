- Episiotomy is the surgical enlargement of the posterior aspect of the vagina by an incision to the perineum during the last part of the second stage of labor.
- Not routinely recommended due to insufficient objective evidence-based data demonstrating benefit or defining the criterion for its use

 ### When to consider: 
- Need for expedited delivery e.g. Category III [[Antepartum fetal surveillance]]
- [[Forceps assisted delivery]] 
- [[Shoulder dystocia]]: cannot prevent but can increase space for operator's fingers and thus facilitate delivery
- [[Female genital mutilation]] especially with Type III infibulation
- Rigid perineum
- [[macrosomia]] 
- Face to pubis delivery
- Breech delivery
- Shoulder dystocia
- Operative delivery â€“ forceps, ventouse
- Previous pelvic floor repair**
### Procedure and selection
- preference is a mediolateral episiotomy because it does not increase the risk of an anal sphincter laceration
- Mediolateral episiotomy is associated with increased blood loss
- One study reported greater pain in women with a mediolateral episiotomy incised 60 degrees off the midline compared with women whose episiotomy was cut 40 degrees off of midline, which could partly contribute to the differing study outcomes
- Incisions
	- Median
	- Mediolateral
	- J-shaped
	- Others
		- T-episiotomy: gives wider opening compared to just median incision
		- Lateral episiotomy
		- Anterior episiotomy for [[Female genital mutilation]]

### Performing episiotomy
1. Patient education and consent
2. Anesthesia:
	1. [[Central Neuraxial Block]] 
	2. [[Pudendal block]]
	3. Local anesthetic
3. Timing: During Crowning (episiotomy performed prior to crowning was associated with increased vaginal trauma, longer mean episiotomy length, and greater mean estimated blood loss)
4. Mediolateral: The final angle of the incision is ideally 60 degrees from the midline to minimize the occurrence of sphincter injury. The incision is usually between 3 and 5 cm in length.

### Structures cut
The anatomic structures incised include the vaginal epithelium, transverse perineal (deep and superficial) and bulbocavernosus muscles, and perineal skin. If the incision is large, adipose tissue within ischiorectal fossa may be exposed.

### Repair
- repair of the vaginal mucosa, repair of the muscle layer and repair of the skin layer
- [[Per rectal examination]]  performed before and after repairing episiotomy to determine extent of the incision and any further lacerations or extensions that might warrant repair
- Adequate pain relief should be provided before suturing.
