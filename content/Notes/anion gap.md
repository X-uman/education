- The anion gap can be used as an index of the severity of the metabolic acidosis and is calculated from the following equation:
- Anion gap = sodium – (chloride + bicarbonate); a normal anion gap is 12±2 mEq/L (or mmol/L)
- At presentation, the presence of a large anion gap in the **absence** of significant ketosis (BOHB <3 mmol) strongly suggests significant [[lactic acidosis]] and the possibility of HHS or sepsis
- During treatment, administration of large amounts of chloride in intravenous (IV) fluids, and preferential renal excretion of ketones rather than chloride, often causes hyperchloremic acidosis. Therefore, the anion gap is a better measure of the effectiveness of treatment and DKA resolution than is the serum bicarbonate concentration.
