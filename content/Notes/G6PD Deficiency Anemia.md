### Definition
- 

### Pathogenesis
- [[X-linked recessive]] inheritance
- G6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (also known as the [[hexose monophosphate shunt]]). This pathway yields NADPH, which is essential for converting oxidized [[glutathione]] back to its reduced form. Reduced glutathione is capable of neutralizing [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) and free radicals and therefore protecting RBCs from oxidative damage.
- In the absence of reduced glutathione (e.g., due to G6PD deficiency), RBCs become susceptible to oxidative stress that can damage [[RBC Membrane]] resulting in intravascular and extravascular hemolysis

- Triggers include
	- [[Fava beans]]
	- [[Antimalarial drugs]]: [[Primaquine]] 
	- [[Sulfonamides]]
	- Infections
	- Inflammation
	- [[Metabolic acidosis]] 
### Presentation
- Most are asymptomatic
- Affects primarily males of African, Mediterranean, and Asian descent
- [[Hemolytic crisis]] following triggers
	- Arise within 2-3 days
	- Sudden onset of back or abdominal pain 
	- Jaundice, dark urine
	- Transient [[splenomegaly]]
- Recurrent severe infections causing [[Chronic granulomatous disease]]

### Diagnostics
- PBS
	- [[heinz bodies]] due to denatured hemoglobin
	- Bite cells due to macrophages selectively removing the denatured hemoglobin inclusions of RBCs
- [[Hemolytic markers]]
- Screening test: [[Fluorescent spot test]] 
- Confirmatory: Quantitative G6PD enzyme analysis
- During hemolysis, false-negative results may occur because older RBCs have been hemolyzed and replaced by reticulocytes and younger RBCs, which have increased G6PD activity. Ideally, both the screening and confirmatory tests should be performed during remission.

### Management
- Avoidance of triggers
- Blood transfusion if severe cases arise 
 - Selective advantage in areas of endemic malaria: As with sickle cell anemia, carriers of the G6PD deficiency may be less severely affected by malaria, especially if the disease is caused by Plasmodium falciparum.
