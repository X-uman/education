### Approach
- Comprehensive history and examination
- Consider discontinuing nonessential drugs to exclude drug fever 
- [[Naproxen test]] 

### Advanced diagnostics
| Laboratory Studies            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Serum ferritin                | Highly elevated levels suggest a noninfectious etiology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Cryoglobulins                 | May be positive in patients with neoplastic disease, inflammatory disease, or viral infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Cold agglutinins              | Elevated in certain infections (e.g., mycoplasma pneumonia, EBV, viral hepatitis), malignancy (e.g., lymphoma), or inflammatory disease.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Uric acid                     | Elevated levels suggest malignancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Further serologic testing     | Such as for EBV infection, CMV infection, brucellosis, bartonellosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Serum protein electrophoresis | Detects monoclonal gammopathy (e.g., multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia) or polyclonal gammopathy (e.g., HIV, malaria, SLE).                                                                                                                                                        |
| Advanced imaging studies      | FDG-PET scan: Consider for all patients without a diagnosis after initial diagnostics, especially those with elevated CRP and/or ESR. Identifies tissues with high metabolic activity, indicating areas that warrant further investigation.                                                      |
|                               | CT or MRI chest and abdomen: Consider if FDG-PET is unavailable or indicates an intrathoracic or intraabdominal abnormality.                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                               | Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE): Consider for suspected bacterial endocarditis.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Invasive tests                | Lymph node biopsy: Consider for patients with lymphadenopathy. Posterior cervical, supra/infraclavicular, and epitrochlear nodes have the highest diagnostic yield. Avoid anterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal node biopsies.                                                               |
|                               | Temporal artery biopsy: Consider in patients ≥ 55 years of age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                               | Liver biopsy: Consider in patients with suspected hepatic involvement (e.g., those with altered liver enzymes or liver abnormalities on imaging studies).                                                                                                                                        |
|                               | Bone marrow studies: Consider bone marrow biopsy if diagnostic clues for myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disease are present. Consider bone marrow culture for suspected culture-negative bacterial endocarditis, miliary tuberculosis, or typhoid fever if it would alter the management. |
|                               | Diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy: Rarely indicated unless a biopsy cannot be obtained using another modality.                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Management
- Avoid NSAIDS/Steroids/Empiric antibiotics in stable patients
- Spontaneous remission in 40%
- Consider empiric antibiotics if suspected
	- [[Miliary tuberculosis]]
	- Culture negative Endocarditis
