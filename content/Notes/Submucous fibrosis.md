### Introduction
- Betel nut chewers: <span style="background:#affad1">Areocoline</span> induces fibrosis of oral submucosa
- [[Chronic Inflammation]] 
- [[dysplasia]] 
- Common In Oral Ca Patients
- Early––Vesicles or Fibrous bands on labial Mucosa associated with Pigmented changes
- Later––Mucosa becomes stiff–hard to open mouth, Tongue becomes smooth. This results in a range of symptoms, including burning sensation in the mouth, restricted mouth opening, difficulty in eating and speaking, and changes in the color and texture of the oral mucosa.
- **microscopy**: 
	- Mucosa–Atrophic, 
	- Prominent sub-epithelial collagen bundles

##### Clinical staging
1. Stage 1: Faucial bands only
2. Stage 2: Faucial and buccal bands
3. Stage 3: Faucial, buccal and labial bands
##### Functional staging 
1. Stage I: Mouth opening >2cm
2. Stage II: Mouth opening 1-2cm
3. Stage III: Mouth opening <1cm

##### microscopy Grading
1. Grade I: Hyperkeratosis
2. Grade II: Epithelial atrophy, Hyalinization
3. Grade III: Hyalinization, Absent connective tissue cellularity
### Management 
- Tobacco cessation
- Wait and watch
- drugs like corticosteroids, collagenase, hyaluronidase
- surgery:  mucosal excision or release, skin grafting, and flaps
- Ulceration: [[Tissue diagnosis]] is mandatory
