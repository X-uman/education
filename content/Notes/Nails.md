##### Mechanism
- 3-point fixation
	- Entry point
	- Fracture site
	- Distal tips 
##### Advantages
- Weight-sharing devices
	- Less stress on implant and reduced risk of [[Implant failure]] 
	- Early weight bearing 
- Can be placed Percutaneously, so 
	- preserves Fracture hematomas: quicker healing and early mobilization
	- Preserves periosteum: So periosteal healing is predominant 
	- Anatomical reduction, fracture compression may not be possible
