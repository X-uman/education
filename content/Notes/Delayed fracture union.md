### Etiologies
- Similar to that of [[delayed wound healing]] 
- Depends upon adequate reduction, immobilization, rehabilitation and tissue perfusion  
- Cortical bones
- Associated injuries, infection
- Comminuted fractures
- Soft tissue interposition 
- Inadequate reduction
- Mobilization
- Non-compression of bones

### Management
- Conservative
	- Eliminate cause of delayed union
	- Adequate fracture immobilization
	- Fracture loading by encouraging muscle exercise and weight bearing exercise
- Operative: > 6 months without signs of callus
