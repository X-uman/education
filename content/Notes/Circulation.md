#### Assessment of circulation
- [[Pulse]] 
	- PR increased in Grade II Shock
	- PR increased + Thready and feeble pulse: Grade III [[Notes/shock]]
	- Cold peripheries: [[cardiovascular collapse]] 
- [[Blood Pressure]] 
- [[Blood loss volume]] 
- [[hemorrhage]] 
#### Management of circulation in shock

| Procedure/Consideration               | Details/Evaluation                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Fluid resuscitation]]               | - Initial management of fluid replacement                 |
| 2 short wide bore peripheral cannulas | - Placement near the heart for rapid infusion             |
| Minimum 2 green [[cannulas]]          | - Size: Green (16G), Orange (14G) for more fluids         |
| Unable to get peripheral vein:        | - Options:                                                |
|                                       | - Cut down Saphenous vein                                 |
|                                       | - [[Intraosseous transfusion]]                            |
|                                       | - Internal Jugular Vein (IJV) if no peripheral vein found |
|                                       | - Note: Subclavian vein (SCV) is best for nutrition       |
| Infuse [[Crystalloids]]               | - Limit to 1 liter to prevent dilutional coagulopathy     |
|                                       | - Options: 7.5% hypertonic saline, Isotonic Normal Saline |
| Best: [[Balanced resuscitation]]      | - Utilization of balanced solutions for resuscitation     |
