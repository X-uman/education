### Introduction
- abnormal proliferation of the endometrial glands relative to the stroma, resulting in an increased gland-to-stroma ratio
- Can coexist with [[Endometrial carcinoma]], both have similar risk factors
### Risk factors
- [[Estrogen exposure]]
- [[HNPCC]] 
- [[PTEN]] mutation 

### Histological classification
![[Pasted image 20240326145745.png]]
- Gland : Stroma ratio
- Cellular polarity
- Benign: Enlarged, dilated mucous membrane glands (Swiss cheese pattern) located between abundant stromal tissue
- [[Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia]] 
- Hyperplasia: simple vs complex
- Atypia: present/absent

### Clinical features
- [[Notes/Abnormal uterine bleeding]]: intermenstrual, constant
- [[Postmenopausal bleeding]] 
### Diagnosis
- Transvaginal USG on thickness of [[endometrium]] 
	- > 1.5 mm premenopausal women
	- > 5 mm in postmenopausal women
- [[Hysteroscopy]]  guided biopsy 
- Lab: [[FSH]], [[LH]], [[Estrogen]], [[Testosterone]] 
- Genetic for HNPCC
### Management
- No atypia: for both pre-menopause or post-menopause
	- [[Progestin therapy]] and regular surveillance
	- If Progestin contraindicated/declined, just regular surveillance is indicated
- EIN: 
	- [[Hysterectomy]] if family completed or post-menopausal 
	- Fertility desired: Progestin therapy with regular endometrial sampling 
	- Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for post-menopausal women
