### Risk factor
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]]  
- Maternal exposure during pregnancy
	- [[Congenital rubella syndrome]] (during the first trimester of pregnancy)
	- Alcohol consumption
	- [[Phenytoin]] use (fetal hydantoin syndrome)
	- Prostaglandin use
- [[Neonatal respiratory distress]] 
- Trisomies (e.g., Down syndrome)
### Pathophysiology
- Ductus arteriosus enables the underdeveloped lungs to be bypassed by the fetal circulation (normal right-to-left shunt) and remains patent in utero via PGE and low O2 tension.
- After birth, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases and thus allows for the reversal of the shunt from right-to-left to left-to-right.
- Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth → persistent communication between the aorta and the pulmonary artery → left-to-right shunt → volume overload of the pulmonary vessels → continuous RV (and/or LV) strain → heart failure (see also “Overview” above)  
- [[Eisenmenger syndrome]] may occur with shunt reversal and manifest with [[Differential cyanosis]] .
### Clinical features
- Small: asymptomatic
- large PDA: Machinery murmur
	- [[Failure to thrive]]
	- [[Heart failure]]
	- Wide [[Pulse pressure]] 
	- [[Pulse volume]] is high 
### Diagnostics
- [[Echocardiography]] 
- [[EKG]]
	- Left axis deviation
- [[Chest X-ray]]
	- Prominent pulmonary artery and aortic knob at the upper left heart border
	- Increased pulmonary markers
- [[Cardiac catheterization]] 
### Management
Here's the information tabulated:

**Interventional**
- Occlusive devices or coils
- Surgical closure of duct
