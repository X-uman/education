### Introduction
- Karyotype
	- ♀: 47,XX,+13
	- ♂: 47,XY,+13
- Incidence: ∼ 1:7,400 live births  [1]
### Pathogenesis
- Meiotic [[nondisjunction]] 
- Abnormal fusion of prechordal mesoderm → midline defects
### Clinical features
- [[Microcephaly]], [[holoprosencephaly]] 
- Characteristic facial anomalies
	- [[Cleft lip & palate]]
	- Low-set, malformed ears
	- Bulbous nose
	- Small chin
	- [[Microphthalmia]] (small orbits, which may be unilateral or bilateral), possibly [[coloboma]], ocular hypotelorism 
- [[Polydactyly]] (primarily hexadactyly), flexed fingers
- Congenital heart defects (particularly ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosis)
- Rocker-bottom feet
- [[Aplasia cutis congenita]]: congenital absence of skin; most commonly scalp lesions with a punched-out appearance that may extend to the bone or the dura 
- [[Omphalocele]]
- Visceral and genital anomalies, especially of the kidneys and ureters (e.g., [[Polycystic Kidney disease]] )
- [[Capillary hemangioma]]

### Diagnostics
- Usually detected during first trimester screening with combined ultrasound and maternal serum testing (↓ PAPP-A, ↑ nuchal translucency)
- Prognosis: Infants usually die before the age of 1, only approx. 11% of infants survive past 12 months of age. [
