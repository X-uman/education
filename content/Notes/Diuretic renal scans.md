| Binding Time          | Takes 3 hours to bind to the kidneys before imaging                                                                            | Immediate imaging as injection enters the body                                                                                                                                  |
| Purpose               | Visualizes renal cortex of the kidneys i.e. Structural analysis                                                                | Provides information on renal blood flow, GFR, tubular function, and urinary excretion                                                                                          |

| Imaging Time          | Imaging starts after 3 hours of injection                                                                                      | Immediate imaging after injection                                                                                                                                               |
| Image Quality         | Provides detailed visualization of renal cortex                                                                                | Provides dynamic information on renal function and excretion                                                                                                                    |
| Duration of Procedure | Longer duration due to binding time                                                                                            | Shorter duration as immediate imaging is performed                                                                                                                              |
