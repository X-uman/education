### Uses
- rate control in AF in Decompensated heart failure 
- Diuretics and digoxin improve symptoms and significantly reduce the number of hospitalizations.

### Cardiac glycosides

| Toxicity    | Less          | More         |
| Metabolism  | Low           | High         |
| Excretion   | Renal         | Bile, Renal  |
### Mechanism
![[Pasted image 20240429145052.png]]
- Increases Intra-cellular Calcium–> Positive Inotropic Action
- Positive Clinotropic Action–> Increases Speed of Conduction in Myocytes
- Also has Vagotonic Effect on SA and AV nodes i.e. negative chronotropic and dromotropic action because vagotonic effect is more than Ca loading

### Adverse reactions
- Risk increased in [[Hypokalemia]], [[hypercalcemia]], Beta-agonists, Cardiac ischemia, [[Hyperthyroidism]], [[Myocarditis]] 
- Cardiac side effects
	- [[Sinus bradycardia]] 
	- [[Heart block]]
	- Shortened QT interval due to positive Clinotropic action, because more calcium is loaded into the cells, also seen in [[hypercalcemia]] 
	- ST-segment sagging is seen: also seen in [[Hypokalemia]] 
- CNS
	- Fatigue, headache, halo
	- Yellow/red vision
