Microsatellite instability pathway in colon cancer: due to methylation or mutations in mismatch repair genes (MMR genes, e.g. MLH1 or MSH2)
Hypermethylation phenotype pathway in colon cancer
	CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP): global hypermethylation of CpG islands â†’ silencing of MMR gene expression
	Associated with BRAF mutations
	Up to 20% of sporadic CRCs develop from serrated polyps that underwent malignant transformation via this pathway.

MMR Gene silencing causes Serrated [[Adenomas]]
