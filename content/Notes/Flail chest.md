- Flail segment defined as radiologic findings of ≥3 consecutive ribs fractured in ≥2 places
- Flail chest defined as paradoxical motion seen on clinical examination
- Anterior flail chest defined as a minimum of three rib or costal cartilage fractures on both sides
### Diagnostics
- Rule out [[Hemothorax]], [[Pneumothorax]], [[Lung Contusion]], [[Sternal fracture]] 
- Ensure [[Oxygenation]]
- [[Pain management]]

### Management
- Scoring to predict morbidity 
	- [[Chest trauma score]]
	- [[Ribscore]] 
- Initial inpatient care
	- [[Chest tube]] placement
	- Fluid management: keep patient euvolemic
	- [[Thromboprophylaxis]] for patients who need prolonged immobilization
	- Prophylactic antibiotics for penetrating trauma
	- [[Pain management]] 
		- NSAIDs
		- Ketamine
		- Regional block: 
			- epidural anesthesia
			- Paravertebral catheter infusion
			- Intercostal nerve blocks
- Pulmonary support
	- [[incentive spirometry]]
	- Avoidance of intubation and timely extubation are associated with decreased mortality
- Pulsed ultrasound for hastened healing

##### Surgical management
- Indications
	- Impending/actual respiratory failure
	- Significant deformity
	- Failure to wean from Mechanical ventilation
	- Significantly displaced ribs found at thoracotomy being performed for other reasons
	- Ongoing chest wall instability or pain due to nonunion or malunion

### Complications
- [[Pneumonia]]
- [[Respiratory failure]]
- [[Retained hemothorax]]
- [[Pleural empyema]]
- Fracture non-union
- Chronic pain and long-term disability

- Fracture of More than or equal to 3 ribs in >=2 places
- [[ATLS]]: >=2 ribs in >=2 places, even 1 rib disarticulation with costochondral junction can cause flail chest
- #associated with Underlying lung contusion which determines its #prognosis 
- #Diagnosis is by clinical examination: Paradoxical respiration
- #ioc 3D CT thorax
- #management 
	- Analgesics
	- Nasal oxygen
	- Intermittent positive pressure ventilation if paO2 <60%
	- Strap the ribs
	- #definite Ribs internal fixation
