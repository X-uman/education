STEPS of Meatal Advancement Glanuloplasty Incorporation 
1. Orthoplasty
2. Urethroplasty
3. Glanoplasty
4. Meatoplasty
5. Scrotoplasty
6. SKin Coverage with [[Circumscision]] or Prepuce Reconstruction

Here are the steps involved in the MAGPI surgery:
1. **Preparation**: The patient is positioned appropriately, and anesthesia (general or local) is administered as per the surgeon's preference.
2. **Incision**: The surgeon makes a V-shaped incision on the ventral (underside) surface of the penis, starting at the meatus (urinary opening) and extending towards the glans (tip) of the penis. The incision is designed to preserve the blood supply to the glans.
3. **Mobilization**: The tissues on either side of the incision are dissected and mobilized to expose the urethral plate, which is the tissue underneath the skin that contains the urethra.
4. **Tubularization**: The urethral plate is tubularized using fine sutures to create a new urethral tube that extends to the tip of the glans.
5. **Closure**: The edges of the V-shaped incision are closed with sutures, resulting in advancement of the meatus towards the tip of the glans.
6. **Glansplasty**: If necessary, additional surgical techniques may be performed to shape and reconstruct the glans to achieve a cosmetically pleasing appearance.
7. **Closure of Skin**: The skin incisions are closed with absorbable sutures, and a dressing may be applied to the surgical site.
8. **Postoperative Care**: The patient is monitored closely in the immediate postoperative period for any signs of complications such as bleeding, infection, or urinary retention. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to assess healing and address any concerns.
