### Introduction
- Aka Gypsum salt
- Calcium sulfate hemihydrate in dry form
- CaSO<sub>4</sub> .2 H20 (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) if mixed with water with [[Exothermic reaction]] and irreversible reaction
- Exothermic reaction on mixing with water
- Types: Home made and ready  made
- Forms: Slab and cast
- Slab covers part of circumference, used for immobilization of soft tissue injury and reinforcing plaster cast
- Cast: Covers whole circumference of limbs
##### After-care of plaster cast
- Check cracks, avoid wetting
- Mobilize joints that are free to move to prevent joint stiffness and disuse atrophy
- Gradual weight bearing
- Replace cast with functional bearing ASAP
