- Effects on [[Nerve fibers]] depends upon 
	- Thinness: A-delta 
	- Myelination: A-delta
	- Rapid firing neuron
	- Sequence: Autonomic-Pain-Temperature-Touch-pressure-motor 
- [[Plasma Protein Binding]] 
	- [[Bupivacaine]] is highly bound: Longer duration
	- Procaine is poorly bound: Short duration
- [[Laws of Diffusion]]
- Lipid solubility: More [[Potency]] but slower Onset
	- Lignocaine/Mepivacaine: Less lipid soluble
	- Bupivacaine/ropivacaine: More lipid soluble
- Vasoconstriction 
- Inflammation: Less effective due to acidic environment, drugs get ionized due to alkaline pKa 
- pKa: More alkaline is the drug, more it gets ionized at physiological pH and slower acting it is
	- Procaine, tetracaine, Bupivacaine: high pKa 
	- Lignocaine, mepivacaine: Low pKa
- [[hypokalemia]] and [[hypercalcemia]] antagonize blockade
