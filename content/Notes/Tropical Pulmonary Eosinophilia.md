### Introduction
- Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) is a clinical manifestation of lymphatic [[filariasis]], a parasitic infection caused by nematodes (roundworms) that inhabit the lymphatics and bloodstream. TPE is caused by an immune hyper-responsiveness to microfilariae that become trapped in the lungs.
- TPE can occur in any tropical area where filariasis occurs and is most common among young adults. 
- It is more common in individuals from the Indian subcontinent and occurs four to seven times more frequently in males than in females. 
- Rarely, a similar hyper-responsive pulmonary syndrome can occur in the setting of other helminth infections.

### Clinical presentation
- Dry, hacking, nonproductive cough, often paroxysmal and nocturnal.
- [[Asthma]]-like attacks with breathlessness and wheezing.
- Minimal or absent chest findings in most patients.
- Auscultation may reveal:
	- Rhonchi
	- Crepitations (especially over the midzones and bases)
	- Wheezing
- Systemic features
	- Weight loss
	- Malaise
	- Fatigue
	- LAN, Hepatosplenomegaly
- Rarely: Cor pulmonale
### Diagnostics
- [[Eosinophilia]] > 3000/microL
- Serum IgE > 1000 units/mL
- marked elevations in filarial antibody titers
- Microfilariae are generally not detectable in peripheral blood, and circulating filarial antigen is undetectable in up to 50 percent of cases
- Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals an intense eosinophilic alveolitis in patients with active disease
- The major chest radiograph findings include increased bronchoalveolar markings, diffuse interstitial lesions (1 to 3 mm in diameter), and/or mottled opacities (usually most prominent in the lower lung fields)
- PFT: restrictive pattern together with mild to moderate airway obstruction
- Airway obstruction is reversible with bronchodilators
### Differential diagnosis
- [[strongyloidiasis]]
- Toxocara
- Ascaris
### Management
- diethylcarbamazine (DEC) given at 6 mg/kg/day in three doses for 12 to 21 days
- If DEC therapy is delayed, progressive interstitial fibrosis and irreversible impairment in pulmonary function can occur.
- Corticosteroid therapy has been used as adjunctive therapy to reduce inflammation in the acute setting but is not definitive therapy for TPE.
- Relapse in 20%: Treatment again with same regimen
- Bronchospasm can generally be managed with bronchodilators, although short-term corticosteroids may be necessary in severe cases.
