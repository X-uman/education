### Pathogenesis

| Manifestation                | Pathophysiology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capillary Leak Syndrome      | - Increased capillary permeability due to endothelial cell dysfunction rather than injury <br> - DENV infects endothelial cells, causing cellular activation via [[Toll-like receptor]] <br> - Soluble NS1 protein contributes to endothelial activation |
| Hematologic Findings         | - Leukopenia due to [[Bone marrow suppression]]<br> - [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]] from platelet destruction and bone marrow suppression <br> - Hemorrhagic diathesis due to vasculopathy, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation abnormalities                 |
| Liver Dysfunction            | - Mild elevation of serum aminotransferases common <br> - Pathologic findings include hepatocellular necrosis and Councilman bodies <br> - Liver injury mediated by DENV infection and potential immune-mediated mechanisms                              |
| Central Nervous System (CNS) | - Rare cases of encephalopathy and true encephalitis reported <br> - DENV detected in brain tissue in some cases <br> - CNS involvement is rare and not the typical manifestation of DENV infection                                                      |
#### Factors influencing disease severity 

| Factor                | Influence on Disease Severity                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Viral Factors         | - DHF can occur with any Dengue serotype, but risk is highest with Dengue-2 viruses <br> - Certain genotypes within each serotype are associated with increased risk of DHF                 |
| Prior Dengue Exposure | - Secondary infections carry higher risk of severe disease (DHF/DSS) <br> - Differences in immune responses between primary and secondary infections contribute to risk                     |
| Age                   | - Risk for DHF declines with age, especially after age 11 years <br> - Infants between 6 and 12 months old are at higher risk due to transplacental antibody decline                        |
| Nutritional Status    | - Some studies suggest DHF/DSS are less common in malnourished children, but evidence is inconsistent                                                                                       |
| Genetic Factors       | - Genetic associations found with specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (MICB, PLCE1) <br> - Racial differences in susceptibility observed <br> - Specific HLA genes associated with DHF |

### Laboratory Diagnosis

**Clinical Approach:**
- Suspect DENV infection in febrile individuals with typical clinical manifestations and relevant epidemiologic exposure to mosquito-borne transmission of DENV infection.
- A provisional diagnosis is usually established clinically, especially in regions with a high incidence of DENV infection.

**Laboratory Testing:**
Sure, here's the information you provided tabulated:

|                    | NS1 antigen test       | - Detection of Dengue NS1 antigen via ELISA<br> - Early detection of viral antigen in serum<br> - Positive confirms diagnosis<br> - Negative does not rule out; further IgM testing needed,<br> - Not recommended after day 7 of symptomatic infection due to low sensitivity |
|                    | Tissue tests (IHC)     | [[Immunohistochemistry]] to detect viral antigens in tissue samples                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Convalescent Phase | Serologic tests        | Testing for IgM and IgG antibodies - IgM for early diagnosis - IgG indicates past exposure                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                    | Molecular Tests (NAAT) | Continued detection of viral RNA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                    | Tissue tests (IHC)     | Immunohistochemical staining for viral antigens in tissues                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This table summarizes the diagnostic tests for dengue infection during both the acute and convalescent phases, including serologic tests, molecular tests, and tissue tests.

- **Detection of Viral Nucleic Acid or Antigen:**
	  - Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for viral nucleic acid detection is typically positive during the first five days of illness.
	  - Detection of viral antigen **nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)** is typically positive during the first seven days of illness, with higher sensitivity in primary infection than secondary infection.
- **Serology:**
	  - Immunoglobulin M (IgM) detection via lateral flow immunoassay or IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can establish a presumptive diagnosis as early as four days after onset of illness.
	  - IgM seroconversion between paired acute and recovery phase specimens (obtained 10 to 14 days after the acute phase) confirms the diagnosis.
	  - IgG detection depends on whether the infection is primary or secondary, with detectable IgG at low titer beginning seven days after onset of illness in primary infection and rapid rise in titer beginning four days after onset in secondary infection.
**Considerations:**
	- Serologic tests may be unreliable in recently vaccinated individuals or those with recent infection or vaccination with antigenically related flaviviruses.
	- Virus isolation (culture) and immunohistochemical staining of tissue samples are rarely used for clinical diagnosis due to limited availability and time frame.
This approach ensures a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for DENV infection, combining clinical suspicion with laboratory confirmation when feasible.

### Management
- [[Dengue-management]] 
- Supportive management
- Paracetamol for fever
- Aspirin, Ibuprofen should be avoided because it may cause platelet dysfunction, gastritis, Vomiting, Acidosis,
- Fluid and Electrolyte replacement and Platelet infusion when count <10k
- Dengue shock is treated with whole blood transfusion and management of shock
