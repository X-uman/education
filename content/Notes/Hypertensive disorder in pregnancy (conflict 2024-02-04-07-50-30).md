[[Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy]]
Pre-eclampsia is one of the three deadly complications:
	- [[Post-partum hemorrhage]]
	- [[sepsis]]
	- [[Hypertension]] 

- Gestational hypertension— hypertension after mid-pregnancy without evidence of Pre-eclampsia resolves by 12 weeks postpartum, 50% subsequently develop preeclampsia.
- Chronic underlying hypertension is diagnosed in women with documented blood pressures ≥ 140/90 mm Hg before pregnancy or before 20 weeks’ gestation, or both.

## Pathogenesis
### Risk Factors
- Chronic [[Hypertension]] predisposes to develop superimposed preeclampsia 
- Young and Nulliparous Women: Preeclampsia
- Old and multiparous women: Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia
- Race and ethnicity: blacks
- [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] except smoking
- [[multiple gestation]]
- History of pre-eclampsia 

### Etiology
1. Placental implantation with abnormal trophoblastic invasion of uterine vessels
2. Immunological maladaptive tolerance between maternal, paternal (placental), and fetal tissues
3. Maternal maladaptation to cardiovascular or inflammatory changes of normal pregnancy
4. Genetic factors including inherited predisposing genes and epigenetic influences.

### Pathophysiology
- [[Endothelial dysfunction]]: 
	- [[Virchow's Triad]], - [[Thrombosis]] and [[Microangiopathic hemolysis]] 
	- Damaged or activated endothelial cells may produce less nitric oxide and secrete substances that promote coagulation and increase sensitivity to vasopressors
	- women with early preeclampsia, have increased vascular reactivity to infused norepinephrine and angiotensin II
- [[Atherosis]] in placental vessels
- Vasospasm 
- [[Starling laws]]: Transudation

- [[Reperfusion injury]] like condition occurring from ischemic placenta inciting [[SIRS]] and vasospasm
	- Circulating endothelial cell 4x 
	- Endothelial microparticles
- Altered [[Cerebral blood flow regulation]] in pregnancy decreases threshold of failure of autoregulation 

## Clinical Features

- All organs might be involved

##### Systemic 
- CVS: [[Left heart failure]] 
- RESPI: [[Pulmonary edema]] 
- ABD: [[Microangiopathic hemolysis]] in liver causes Hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation leading to stretched capsule
- CNS: [[cerebral hyperperfusion]] i.e. SBP >160 and [[microvascular thrombosis]] 
	- Headaches or visual disturbances such as [[scotoma]] can be premonitory symptoms of eclampsia. 
	- [[Notes/Headache]] and visual symptoms are common with severe preeclampsia, and associated convulsions define eclampsia.
	- [[Generalized tonic-clonic seizure]] seizures

##### Systemic
- [[Korotkoff Sounds]]: Phase V is used to define diastolic pressure
- A sudden rise in mean arterial pressure later in pregnancy—also known as “delta hypertension”—may also signify preeclampsia even if blood pressure is < 140/90 mm Hg


## Complications
### Local
- Liver: Sub-capsular hematoma, capsular rupture, its risk is increased in HELLP syndrome

### General
- [[placental abruption]]


## Diagnosis
#### Physiological 
- Urine: [[Nephrotic Syndrome]], [[Acute Kidney Injury]] 
	- 24hr Urinary Protein Excretion > 300mg, features can be similar to [[Nephrotic Syndrome]] ? 
	- [[Protein Creatinine Ratio]] >= 0.3
	- Persistent 30 mg/dl (1+) in random urine samples
	- Urine Output: [[Oliguria]]

- Blood
	- [[Microangiopathic hemolysis]] 
		- Platelets < 100,000/mcl, which begins to rise 4-5 days post-partum, but in [[HELLP Syndrome]] continues to fall
		- Intravascular [[Hemolysis]] 
		- Markers for [[Thrombosis]] 
	- [[RFT]]: Creatinine > 1.1 mg/dl or doubling the baseline, [[Uric Acid]], diminished [[Calcium]] excretion.
	- [[LFT]]: Transaminases 2x the normal

	- [[Coagulation panel]] is normal and insignificant for management
	

#### Anatomical (Imaging)
- [[CT-scan]] of head: Not routinely done except in [[Focal neurological deficits]]
	- [[Hemorrhagic Stroke]] 
	- Features of [[posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome]]—PRES, most frequently affected region is the parietooccipital cortex

#### Histopathological
- Renal biopsy: Glomerular Endotheliosis and podocytes approximation
- Liver biopsy: Areas of peri-portal hemorrhage, infarction
- Vessels biopsy: [[Hypertensive vasculopathy]] 


## Management
### Symptomatic
- Anti-oxidants and calcium show no benefits in preeclampsia
- [[Magnesium Sulfate for seizure prophylaxis]]  
- Intensive [[Fluids]] are not indicated for oliguria unless diminished urine output is from [[hemorrhage]] or fluid loss from vomiting or fever.

## Differential diagnoses
- [[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] is sometimes confused with preeclampsia. It too has onset in late pregnancy, often there is accompanying hypertension, abnormal liver tests, and [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]]
