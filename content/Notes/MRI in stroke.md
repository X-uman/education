- Reperfusion hyperemia


### Hemorrhagic stroke

A slightly hyperintense lesion with a hypointense periphery (arrows) is seen in the area of the right basal ganglia.
These findings are consistent with a hyperacute intracerebral hemorrhage. The hypointense border, which results from deoxygenated hemoglobin, is a characteristic feature. In contrast to oxygenated hemoglobin (which is the main component of a hyperacute hemorrhage), oxygen-deficient hemoglobin has a paramagnetic effect, which leads to a signal decrease in the gradient-echo sequence.
