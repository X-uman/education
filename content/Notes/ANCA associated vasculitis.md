==p-ANCA==
Aberrant epigenetic expression of proteinase-3 on the cell membrane of neutrophils
Formation of antibodies against proteinase-3 (PR3-ANCA) 
Binding of PR3-ANCA to PR3 activates neutrophils → release of neutrophilic inflammatory mediators, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, complement activation → damage to endothelial cells of small blood vessels
