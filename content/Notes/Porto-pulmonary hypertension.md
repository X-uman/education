- Diagnosis of Exclusion of Cirrhosis

### Pathophysiology
- High cardiac output in advanced liver disease → wall shear stress in pulmonary vasculature → ↑ vasoactive and angiogenic substances (e.g., endothelin-1) → hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, fibrosis of intimal sheath, and micro-aneurysms of pulmonary arterioles 
- [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
- [[Right Heart Failure]] 
### Diagnosis
- [[Echocardiography]]
- [[Cardiac catheterization]] 
- Diagnostic criteria
	- Features of [[Portal Hypertension]] 
### Treatment
- Pharmacotherapy
	- Treat PAH
	- Avoid [[Beta-Blockers]] for variceal treatment for POPH
- Definitive: [[Liver transplantation]]
