- [[ARDS definition]] 
- [[Alveolar flooding]] **not** due to [[Left heart failure]] 
- [[Respiratory failure]] 
	- Type 1 initially
		 - [[A-a gradient]] Increased
		 - [[PaO2]]:[[FiO2]] <= 300 mm Hg
	- Type 2 later due to Exhaustion from [[Dyspnea]] 
- [[ARDS Severity]] 
- [[Acute lung injury (Diffuse alveolar damage)]] 
- [[Surfactant deficiency]] 
- [[lung compliance]] and [[Atelectasis]] 
- Hyaline Membrane formation and Symmetrical Ground glass appearance like in Infant 
- Intrapulmonary Shunting
- [[Pulmonary fibrosis]] 

### Diagnose
- Diagnose ARDS:
	- ABG
	- Chest X-ray 
	- Echocardiography and ECG
- Find underlying cause
### Management
- Treat underlying cause
- [[Supportive measures]] 
	- [[ARDS Severity]] 
	- [[Lung protective ventilation]]  
	- [[Fluids]] should be conservative: Minimize [[PCWP]] 
	- [[Thromboprophylaxis]] 
	- [[Stress ulcer or Curling ulcers]] prophylaxis
	- [[Surgical Nutrition]] 
- [[ECMO]] 
- Steroids, Surfactants, HF Jet ventilation avoided 
### Differential Diagnosis of ARDS:
- Cardiogenic Pulmonary edema
- Bilateral [[Pneumonia]]
- Alveolar injury
- Acute interstitial pneumonitis
- Acute [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]]
- Toxin Injury and Radiation injury
- Neurogenic [[Pulmonary Edema]]
