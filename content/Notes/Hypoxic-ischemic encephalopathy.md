### Prognosis
- Mild: 99% babies have normal outcome
- Moderate: 80% have normal outcome
- Severe: 50% mortality and 50% severe neurological sequalae 

### Time = Brain
- decrease [[Metabolic demand]]
	- [[Therapeutic Hypothermia]]
- [[Supportive measures]] 
	- Recent studies indicate a neuroprotective effect of [[erythropoietin]] in neonates with HIE.
	- While maintaining adequate [[end-organ perfusion]] is important in children with HIE, [[Fluid overload]] should be avoided due to the possible subsequent development/worsening of brain [[edema]].

### Complications 
 - CNS complications: Chronic [[Focal neurological deficits]]
	- [[Cerebral palsy]] (most likely spastic quadriplegia due to involvement of **Parasagittal area** or dyskinetic cerebral palsy) in term patients
		- [[Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)]] is the most common effect on brain in [[Prematurity or preterm birth]], so babies develop Spastic diplegia 
	- [[Epilepsy]]
	- [[Specific learning disorders]]
	- [[ADHD]]
	- [[intellectual disability]]
	- Hearing and/or visual impairment

### [[Multiorgan dysfunction]]

### Diagnostics
- [[APGAR score]] at 5 and 10 min: < 5
- Umbilical artery pH < 7
- Arterial [[base deficit]] >= 12 mmol/L
- Neuroimaging evidence: deep nuclear gray matter injury, parasagittal injury of the cerebral cortex, and watershed cortical injury
- Presence of [[Multiorgan dysfunction]] 
- Biomarkers: [[VEGF]] is a marker of subsequent encephalopathy
- EEG, ECG, CNS USG

### Management
- [[Neuroprotective measures]] 
- Monitoring:
	- Amplitude integrated EEG ( 2 leads): Bed side EEG to monitor seizures 
- For moderate to severe HIE: [[Therapeutic Hypothermia]] 

### Prognosis
- MILD: Normal 
- MODERATE TO SEVERE: FND
