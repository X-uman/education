• C. diphtheriae has both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains; toxigenic strains contain a beta-prophage gene (tox), which encodes for the exotoxin diphtheria toxin
• Mechanism of action: ADP-ribosylation of the elongation factor-2 (EF-2) → inhibition of EF-2 → arrested protein translation and synthesis → cell death and necrosis
• Local effects of the toxin: destruction of the respiratory epithelium with a subsequent inflammatory response

• Rapid: Albert stain of oropharyngeal swab
• Culture: Cysteine-Tellurite Agar: Black colonies
• Loeffler medium: Metachromatic granules
• Other tests: used to identify whether the strain is toxigenic once the culture reveals C. diphtheriae
• Elek test
	○ Positive if the strain is toxicogenic
• Polymerase chain reaction: to identify the tox gene
