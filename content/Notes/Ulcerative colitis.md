### Introduction
- Ulcero-Inflammatory disorder
### Gross
- Affects Mucosa and Submucosa 
- Always involves Rectum––> Extends Proximally in continuous fashion––> Part of(––>extends no farther than transverse colon) / Entire colon(––> Pancolitis).
- Limited Distal Disease––> Ulcerative Proctitis or Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis (LLQ pain)
- Small Intestine––> Normal, But Terminal Ileum––> Mild Mucosal Inflammation may be present––> Backwash Ileitis (makes it difficult to differentiate from [[Crohn disease]])
- No Skip Lesions––> Continuous distribution
- During Acute inflammation–mucosa is edematous, ==hyperemic==, granular, friable and bleeds to touch
- Unaffected Mucosa between lesions––> Interconnect––> Form Tunnels and Mucosal Bridges
- Ulcers––> aligned Longitudinally but not in serpentine fashion––> Sharp demarcation between Ulcerated and normal Mucosa––Broad Based superficial Ulcers
- Normal mucosa––> Bulge into lumen––>==Pseudopolyps==––> Interconnect––> Form Tunnels and Mucosal Bridges
- Chronically With time → healing→ progressive mucosal atrophy–flattened and attenuated mucosal surface and folds
- No Mural Thickening, Normal Serosal Surface, No Stricture formation


### Micro 
- Features Similar to CD→ Inflammatory Infiltrates, Crypt Abscesses and Cryptitis, Crypt Distortion, i.e. Erosive inflammation
- Pseudo pyloric Epithelial Metaplasia
- However––> [[Inflammation]] is Diffuse(no granulomas) and Limited to Mucosa and Superficial Submucosa
- Ulcers––> Mucosal, Extend up to Submucosa in serious cases, Muscularis Propria is rarely involved
- Remission –granulation tissue fills the ulcer craters, followed by regeneration of the mucosal epithelium
- Repeated inflammation: Submucosal Fibrosis, Muscle Atrophy, 
- Repeated regeneration: Distorted Mucosal Architecture––> Persist even after the disease
- Cytoplasmic Mucins Diminished

### Presentation
- Whites > non-whites, 
- 20-25 years old (Bimodal distribution with smaller peak at >55 y)
- Rare in Asia, Africa and South America, M=F
- Ashkenazi Jews: 3-5x 
- Relapsing Disorder
- Bloody Diarrhea, [[Hematochezia]]
- Stringy Mucoid material
- Lower Abdominal Pain
- Cramps, relieved by defecation persisting for day, weeks or months. Initial Attacks may be Medical Emergency––> Serious bleeding, electrolyte and fluid disturbances, Fever and wt loss
>	- 50% have mild disease, [[Colectomy]] cures the disease, Smoking may relieve the symptoms
- [[Diarrhea]] 
### Complications
- Massive Hemorrhage
- [[Fulminant Ulcerative colitis]] 
- Recurrent episodes: [[Iron deficiency anemia]]
- [[Bowel Perforation]] 
- Iliac vein [[Thrombosis]] 
- [[Toxic Megacolon]] 
- [[Notes/Strictures|Strictures]] to be taken as malignant until proven otherwise 
- Perforation with [[Peritonitis]]
- Carcinoma Colon(To follow up -for dysplasia & colonic Ca by repeated colonoscopic biopsy)
- [[Amyloidosis]] 
- [[IBD extra-intestinal manifestations]] 
### Diagnosis
- [[Endoscopy]] ([[Colonoscopy]]) contraindicated in severe disease (High risk of [[Bowel Perforation]])
	- Early
		- Friable mucosa
		- Fibrin coated [[ulcers]]
		- Loss of superficial vascular pattern
	- Late findings
		- Loss of haustra, mucosal folds
		- Strictures
		- Deep ulcerations
		- Pseudopolyps
- Severe: [[Sigmoidoscopy]]
- [[UGI endoscopy]] to rule out [[Crohn disease]] 
- Abdominal X-ray
	- Lead pipe appearance in severe cases
	- Indicated in Complications: Megacolon, Ulceration, Perforation
- CT/MRI for abdominal symptoms that cannot be explained by disease activity seen in Endoscopy and complications and differential diagnoses
	- Loss of Haustra
	- Increased bowel wall thickness
	- Mural Enhancement
	- Signs of complications
- [[Barium study]] 
	- Granular appearance of mucosa
	- Deep ulcerations
	- Loss of Haustra
	- Pseudopolyps
- USG to monitor disease activity and treatment response
	- Finding: Mural thickening
- [[pANCA]] detected
- [[ASCA]] Positive in only 20% of cases unlike CD 
- [[Fecal Calprotectin]] for severity grading 

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Noninfectious colitis]] 
- [[Infectious colitis]] 
- [[Celiac diseases]]
- [[Inflammatory diarrhea]] 
- [[Microscopic colitis]] 

### Management
- Classification by disease extent
	- [[Montreal Classification of UC]] 
- Classification by Severity
	- Endoscopy
	- Clinical: [[Truelove and Witts severity index for UC]]
	- Combine: [[UC Activity index]] 

#### Treatment

| Severity          | Components                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Mild - Moderate   | [[5-ASA]], Steroids                          |
| Moderate - Severe | Steroids, Biologicals, +/- [[Azathioprine]]  |
| Severe            | IV Steroids, Immunosuppressants, Biologicals |

| Other Interventions         | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proctocolectomy             | Curative treatment for certain cases of severe UC                                                                                                                |
| Colorectal Cancer Screening | Start screening 8–10 years after initial diagnosis or at the time of diagnosis of PSC.<br>Modality: ileocolonoscopy with biopsies.<br>Interval: every 1–5 years. |
