[[Sickling.png]]
### Pathophysiology
- Abnormal molecular structure of hemoglobin
- Polymerization during deoxygenated state
- Sickling and deformation of RBCs
- Decreased Membrane flexibility
- RBCs cannot pass through capillaries
- Tissue ischemia and necrosis
	- Joints: Arthritis
	- Fingers: [[Dactylitis]] 
	- Brain: [[Stroke in young]], [[Transient Ischemic Attack]] 
	- Lungs
	- Liver
	- heart 
	- Spleen: [[Autosplenectomy]] 
	- [[Priapism]] 
	- Barrow marrow necrosis: Bone marrow embolization to lungs: Like [[Pulmonary Embolism]], its called [[Acute chest syndrome]]
	- Kidney: 
		- [[renal papillary necrosis]] 
		- [[Renal medullary carcinoma]] 
		- [[Hyposthenuria]] 
		- Recurrent UTIs 
### Presentation
- Sickle cell trait
	- Often asymptomatic
	- Painless gross hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis often the only symptom
	- Other kidney afflictions may be seen
- **Sickle cell disease** 
	- [[Vaso-occlusive events]] 
	- Infections due to [[Functional asplenia]]
	- [[Hemolytic crisis]] 
	- **Chronic manifestations**
		- Chronic hemolysis
		- Chronic pain
		- [[Pigment stones]] 
### Diagnostics
- [[Sickle cell anemia screening.png]]
- Perform confirmatory studies within the first 2 months of age for infants with a positive or inconclusive result on sickle cell disease screening: [[Protein analysis]] 

##### Additional tests
- CBC: Anemia, raised [[Inflammatory markers]] 
- PBS
	- Sickle cells, target cells
	- [[Howell-Jolly bodies]] occur with [[Functional asplenia]] 
- [[Hemolytic markers]]
- [[Extramedullary Hematopoiesis]] markers: rare in sickle cell hemolysis 
- PBS: Sickled RBCs
- Hemoglobin [[Electrohoresis]]: HbS
- Genetic (DNA analysis): **Mutation of Beta chain of Hemoglobin at Chromosome 7, Glutamate is replaced by valine**

### Management

##### Long term management
- Infants and children
	- Immunizations
	- Antibiotic prophylaxis against invasive pneumococcal disease until 5 years of age
		- Daily prophylactic penicillin 
	    - Recommended from early infancy (1â€“2 months of age) until 5 years of age for children with HbSS 
	    - Continue penicillin prophylaxis in children who have had a [[splenectomy]] or history of invasive pneumococcal infection.
		- Erythromycin prophylaxis is suitable for children with penicillin allergy.
	- [[Hydroxyurea]] therapy regardless of clinical severity to minimize disease-related complications
	- Annual [[Transcranial doppler]] to screen for stroke risk from 2 months till 16 years of age
	- Regular monitoring for other common complications of sickle cell disease
- Adults
	- Immunizations
	- Hydroxyurea therapy if clinically indicated
	- Reproduction counselling and contraception
	- Regular monitoring for complications of sickle cell disease
- Educate all patients or caregivers on: 
	- Signs and symptoms of complications of sickle cell disease
	- Importance of attending regular screenings
	- How to seek specialist medical advice
	- Treatment options (e.g., hydroxyurea, HSCT)
### Acute Management
- Oxygenation
- [[Blood Transfusion]]
- Fluids
- Analgesic 
### Prevention of sickling
- Prevent stressful conditions
- Regular blood transfusion
- [[Hydroxyurea]]: Stimulates [[Fetal Hemoglobin]] 
- Folate: prophylactically 5 mg/day lifelong
- [[Splenectomy]] 
- Curative: [[Allogenic bone marrow transplantation]]
