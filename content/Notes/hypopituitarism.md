### Etiology
- Absent pituitary gland/congenital hypopituitarism
	- [[Prader-Willi syndrome]]
	- [[Kallman Syndrome]]
	- [[Laurence Moon]] 
- [[Space Occupying Lesion]]
- [[Tissue Infiltration]]
- Pituitary injury
	- [[Pituitary apoplexy]]: pituitary infarction due to ischemia/hemorrhage  
	- [[Sheehan syndrome]] due to ischemia resulting from [[Hypovolemic shock]]
	- [[Traumatic brain injuries]]
	- [[CNS infections]] 
	- [[Radiotherapy]] 
### Pathogenesis
Here's a table comparing the hormone deficiencies and their associated clinical manifestations:

| Hormone Deficiency                                            | Clinical Manifestations                                                                                         | Measurements                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Growth Hormone (GH)                                           | - Growth retardation during childhood<br>- Decreased bone density<br>- Muscle atrophy<br>- Hypercholesterolemia | [[IGF-1]] levels, [[GH stimulation test]] |
| Prolactin                                                     | - [[Lactation failure]] following delivery in women, men are asymptomatic                                       | Routine testing is not recommended        |
| Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) / Luteinizing Hormone (LH) | - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism)                                                        |                                           |
| Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)                             | - Secondary [[hypothyroidism]]                                                                                  |                                           |
| Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)                            | - Secondary [[adrenal insufficiency]]                                                                           |                                           |
| [[ADH]] deficiency                                            | Central [[diabetes insipidus]]                                                                                  |                                           |
| [[Oxytocin]] deficiency                                       | No effect                                                                                                       |                                           |
### Diagnostics
- Pattern of hormone deficiency may vary, so check all hormones individually
- If hormone deficiency is identified, [[Neuroimaging]] preferably MRI is indicated to find the cause
	- Common findings are [[Space Occupying Lesion]] like [[Pituitary adenoma]]
