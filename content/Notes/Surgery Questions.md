## Classify [[Head injuries]] ? How will you manage patient with head injury?
##### Classification of head injury

Depending upon severity (GCS, duration of unconsciousness and post traumatic amnesia)
	- mild, >12 GCS, <30min, <1 d
	- Moderate >8, <24 hrs., 1d to 1 week
	- Severe <=8, >24 hrs., >1 week

Depending upon impact of injury on different parts of head: 
Closed Injury (Scalp injury)
	- Abrasion
	- Contusion
	- Scalp Laceration
	- [[Sub-galeal hemorrhage]] 

 Skull injury
	- Closed # vs Open #

	- [[Blow out fracture]]  of orbit

Open injury: When dura mater is breached and brain is arachnoid is exposed 
	- Penetrating
	- Intracranial foreign body  e.g. Gunshot
	- Perforating: E.g. Gunshot

 Traumatic - [[Intracranial Hemorrhage]] 
	- [[Extradural hemorrhage]]

	- Routine Spinal tap and CSF analysis: Rules out other conditions
	- Intermittent high volume tap: Improvement of symptoms with careful removal of 30 to 60 mL of CSF may indicate an eventual positive response to ventriculoperitoneal shunting
	- Prolonged lumbar drainage for 3-5 days: indicative of eventual response to CSF diversion.
	- [[ICP monitoring]]: may reveal intermittent spikes of Elevated pressure
	- [[Neuroimaging]] like CT and MRI to rule out alternate diagnosis


- Surgical management:
	- [[Ventricular shunts]]
	- Ventriculopleural shunting
	- Ventriculoatrial shunting

	- Hydroureteronephrosis
	- Acute Kidney Injury (Post renal)
	- Urinary tract infections
	- Bladder stones

##### Investigations
- [[Uroflowmetry]] should be done to assess the severity of obstruction
- Underlying cause can be investigated by doing 
	- Pelvic USG: Prostrate size, post-void urine 
	- Cystoscopy: Bladder carcinoma
	- CT-KUB plane for Radio-opaque bladder stones
	- Contrast enhanced CT for bladder neck tumors

## [[Investigations of LUTS]]

- Urethrography: Possible strictures
- Cystourethrography: Anterograde and retrograde, for obstruction and diverticula
- Pelvic USG: for possible Prostrate enlargement and resultant hydroureteronephrosis
- CT KUB for possible bladder stones

## Surgical anatomy of [[Prostrate]] 
Zones of prostrate: 
![[Pasted image 20231001164326.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231001164545.png]]
- BPH: happens in Transitional zone (Median lobe)
- Prostrate carcinoma: Happens in Peripheral zone (Posterior lobe)

- Arterial supply: 3 arteries
	- Inferior vesical
	- middle rectal 
	- Internal pudendal 

- Venous drainage: Prostatic venous plexus drains into Internal iliac veins 
- Lymphatic drainage:  internal iliac lymph nodes. From the internal iliac lymph nodes the drainage is to the common iliac lymph nodes and, finally, to the lumbar lymph nodes. Each side drains ipsilaterally
- Nerve supply: sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory innervation from the **inferior hypogastric plexus** which may get damaged during radical prostatectomy leading to erectile dysfunction (they also supply the penis)

## Clinical [[Features of Raised ICP]] 
Symptoms:
	- Headache (most commonly occipital, morning headache, increases on coughing, straining)
	- Projectile Vomiting
	- [[Altered consciousness]] 
	- Visual disturbances due to papilledema 
	- Seizures
	- Focal neurological deficit if focal lesion present

Signs:
	- [[Papilledema]] on [[Direct ophthalmoscopy]]
	- Cushing triad of raised ICP: Systemic sings
		- Irregular breathing 
		- Hypertension (compensatory mechanism to pump blood into head)
		- Bradycardia 
	- [[False localizing signs]]: Focal signs of raised ICP
		- [[Abducens nerve]] gets compressed against the ridge of petrous temporal bone leading to Lateral gaze palsy
		- [[Oculomotor nerve]] gets compressed against free edge of [[tentorium cerebelli]] leading to Fixed dilated pupil (Hutchinson pupil)
		- [[Trochlear nerve palsy ]] 
		- Contralateral hemiparesis: Compression of ipsilateral [[Cerebral peduncle]] against tentorial edge by [[Transtentorial herniation]] of [[temporal lobe]] 
		- Ipsilateral hemiparesis: Compression of contralateral cerebral peduncle by free edge of tentorium ([[Kernohan's notch]])

In infants: additional features due to pliable head
	- Enlarged head (macrocephaly) with distended and visible veins
	- Fullness of anterior fontanelle
	- Sunset sign


## Etiology of [[Notes/Hydrocephalus]]
Etiology: Excess accumulation of CSF can be due to:
	1. Increased production
	2. Decreased circulation
	3. Decreased drainage through arachnoid villi 

- Increased production of CSF (Communicating)
	- Choroidal plexus tumor (Produces more CSF)

- Obstruction at [[CSF circulation]] (Obstructive/Non-communicating hydrocephalus)
		- [[Foramen of munro]]: Colloidal cyst
		- Cerebral aqueduct: [[Aqueductal stenosis]]
		- Foramen of Luschka and Magendie:
			- Cerebellar tumors: [[Medulloblastoma]]
			- [[Dandy walker malformation]]
			- [[Arnold Chiari malformation]]
			- [[Tuberculous meningitis]] 

- Impaired drainage of CSF to Dural venous sinuses: Clogging of arachnoid villi (Communicating)
	- RBCs: After [[Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage]]
	- Tumors: 
	- Scarring: After [[Meningitis]] 
	- Blockage of Dural venous sinuses due to [[Thrombosis]]
	- Blockage of internal jugular vein: Brain tumor at bas of brain 

##### On the basis of Intracranial pressure:
1. high pressure Hydrocephalus (Non communicating)
2. [[Normal pressure hydrocephalus]] (Chronic variant of communicating hydrocephalus in Old patients) 


## Primary and secondary brain injuries
##### Primary brain injury
- Caused directly by trauma. 
- Can be focal (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, contusion) or diffuse (e.g., diffuse axonal injury, cerebral edema).

##### Secondary brain injury
indirect brain injury that results from physiological changes triggered by acute CNS insults and/or treatment measures for acute CNS insults that affect ICP, oxygenation, blood pressure, etc

- Disruption of [[Blood brain barrier]]: Leading to [[Cerebral edema]] and raised [[Intracranial pressure]] 
- ischemia: Due to cerebral vasoconstriction then, hypoxia leading to neuronal cell death
- Hyperglycemia due to stress: Endothelial dysfunction leading to vascular dysfunction: Vasoconstriction/dilatation lading to cerebral hypoxia or Cerebral hyperemia
- hypotension impairing cerebral perfusion
- hypercapnia (excessive carbon dioxide levels in the blood);
- meningitis (infection of the meningeal layers) and brain abscess;
- biochemical changes (changes in levels of neurotransmitters, sodium, potassium, etc.) and then epilepsy
- Injury to hypothalamus and/or pituitary → neurogenic fever and central diabetes insipidus 

##### [[Neuroprotective measures]] are done to minimize secondary brain injury
- Adequate [[oxygenation]]: Avoid hypoxia, but also do not give excessive Oxygen (Free radical injury)
- Monitor Blood Pressure: Avoid Hypotension , MAP should be between 65-100 mm Hg, and CPP should be 60-70 mm Hg
- Monitor Intracranial pressure: [[ICP monitoring]] methods and bring down ICP ([[Management of raised ICP]])
- Monitor Carbon Dioxide: Avoid Hypercapnia or Hypocapnia 
- Glucose monitoring: Manage hyperglycemia
- Electrolyte monitoring
- Treat [[Hyponatremia]] or [[Hypernatremia]]
- Treat [[Hypokalemia]] or [[Hyperkalemia]] 
- Seizure Prophylaxis for severe traumatic brain injury (GCS <=8)
- Levetiracetam
- Phenytoin 
- Antibiotic prophylaxis for possible infection in damaged tissue
- Temperature regulation: Manage neurogenic/central Hyperthermia
	 - Head cooling externally: cooling helmet/blanket
	 - Endovascular cooling: Cold IV saline
	 - Pharmacological cooling: [[Opioids]] or Cannabinoids
	 - antipyretics: [[Acetaminophen]] 
- Nutritional management: According to [[Notes/Metabolic response to injury]], [[Hypermetabolism]] should be supported by Enteral(Preferred) or Parenteral nutrition ([[parenteral nutrition]])


## [[Monroe Kelly doctrine ]]
Total skull Volume: 1700 ml (Fixed due to bony architecture, but flexible in infants)
	Brain: 80%
	CSF: 10%
	Blood: 10%
		Arterial: 5%
		Venous: 5%

Skull volume = Brain + CSF + Arterial Blood + Venous Blood

If the volume of any one of above increases, then remaining others must decrease in volume to compensate to maintain normal ICP
e.g. 
	- Increased Brain size: [[Cerebral edema]], Brain tumors, Brain abscess
	- Increased CSF: Hydrocephalus
	- Increased Arterial Blood: Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage
	- Increased Venous blood: Sub-Dural hemorrhage, [[dural sinus thrombosis]], 

ICP increases once following components are displaced to accommodate the increased volume of Intracranial contents:
- Initially CSF is displaced
- Then Venous blood is pushed out
- Then Arterial flow decreases (Decreased [[cerebral perfusion]] Pressure)
- Then brain is displaced i.e. [[Cerebral herniation]] which may be 
	- [[Subfalcine herniation]]
	- [[Uncal herniation]]
	- [[Central herniation]]
	- [[Transcalvarial herniation]]
	- [[Tonsillar herniation]] 
	- [[Upward transtentorial herniation]]
