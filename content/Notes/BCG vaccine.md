### Stages
| **Stage**       | **Description**                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Redness         | Immediately after vaccination, the site may become red due to the immune response.                     |
| Wheal formation | A few days post-vaccination, a small blister may form at the injection site.                           |
| Ulceration      | The blister may burst, resulting in the formation of a small ulcer within 1-2 weeks after vaccination. |
| Scab Formation  | The ulcer gradually heals, and a scab forms over the injection site.                                   |
| Scar Formation  | After a few weeks, the scab falls off, leaving behind a small scar that varies in size and appearance. |
