### Introduction
- Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, painful, follicular, occlusive disease that affects the folliculopilosebaceous unit mainly, but not exclusively, in intertriginous axillary, groin, perianal, perineal, genital, and inframammary skin.
- Similar pathogenesis like [[Acne vulgaris]] i.e. blockage of [[Hair follicle]], mainly in [[Intertriginous areas]], hence it is aka acne inversa

### Risk factors
- Obesity, Smoking
- Poor hygiene
- [[Diabetes Mellitus]], Steroids 
- The highest incidence of HS is seen in young women. 
- Risk factors such as smoking, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, and a family history of HS are associated with a more severe disease course. 

### Pathogenesis
- **Follicular occlusion**: Initial development of HS lesions likely occurs due to follicular occlusion, resulting from ductal keratinocyte proliferation, causing follicular hyperkeratosis and plugging.
- Contributing factors to follicular occlusion: Effects of hormones and nicotine on the follicular epithelium may contribute to follicular hyperkeratosis and plugging.
- **Anoxia within the follicular duct**: Secondary to follicular epithelial hyperplasia may disrupt normal terminal differentiation of follicular keratinocytes, leading to follicular plugging.
- Mechanical stress: Pressure, friction, or shear on the skin, especially in intertriginous areas, leads to leakage of molecular-sized antigens stimulating the adaptive and innate immune systems.
- Cytokine release: Activated keratinocytes release proinflammatory mediators, leading to perifolliculitis.
- **Follicular rupture**: Failure of sufficient repair of the compromised follicular duct may lead to rupture, releasing macro follicular contents and further recruiting inflammatory cells.
- Support defects: Defects in the support of the follicular wall may predispose individuals to follicular rupture.
- Basement membrane zone changes: Reduction in periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of the basement membrane zone at the sebofollicular junction may contribute to follicular rupture.
- **Formation of skin tunnels**: Follicular rupture may promote the formation of skin tunnels through the release of stem cells from the hair follicle bulge area.
- **Dysregulation of the immune system**: Likely contributes to HS etiology, as observed similarities between HS and Crohn disease, suggesting involvement of dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems.
- Role of immune dysregulation: Activation of innate and adaptive immune systems in response to follicular duct rupture may play a primary role in HS initiation.
- Implicated immune components: Interleukin (IL) 17, caspase-1-associated cytokines IL-1-beta and IL-18, complement system components C3a and C5a, keratinocytes, B cells, plasma cells, and associated immunoglobulin production and complement activation.

### Presentation
- Localized in [[Intertriginous areas]] containing apocrine glands (most commonly the axillae, groin, inner thigh, perineal and perianal areas)
- Often bilateral axilla
- Multiple discharging sinuses, and tender nodules
- Induration due to fibrosis 
- The first lesion is usually a solitary painful inflammatory nodule that progresses to an abscess that may open or regress spontaneously.
- Sinus tracts may form between multiple recurrent nodules and drain foul-smelling, seropurulent discharge.
- Development of open ; and closed comedones
- Scarring ranges from small, individual acneiform scars to thick scarred plaques that affect larger areas of skin.
- The clinical course is highly variable, ranging from relatively mild disease characterized by the recurrent appearance of papules, pustules, and a few inflammatory nodules to 
- severe cases demonstrating deep, fluctuant abscesses; draining skin tunnels; and severe, rope-like scars

### Staging

| Stage     | Description                                                                                                         | Therapy                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Stage I   | Abscess formation (single or multiple) without skin tunnels and cicatrization/scarring                              | [[Isotretinoin]]<br>[[Doxycycline]]<br>[[Adalimumab]] |
| Stage II  | Recurrent abscesses with skin tunnels and scarring, single or multiple widely separated lesions                     |                                                       |
| Stage III | Diffuse or almost diffuse involvement, or multiple interconnected skin tunnels and abscesses across the entire area |                                                       |


### Differential diagnosis
- Severe [[Acne vulgaris]]
- [[Folliculitis]] 
- [[Granuloma inguinale (Donovanosis)]]
- [[Crohn disease]] 

### Management
- High rate of recurrence
- Local/systemic antibiotics
- Stage 1: only nodules seen 
	- [[Isotretinoin]]
	- [[Doxycycline]]
	- [[Adalimumab]] 
- Clindamycin and [[rifampicin]] in severe disease
- Acute lesions: [[I&D]]
- Chronic: Local excision and [[Skin graft]] 
- Surgery should not be used in isolation; combining surgery with dietary restrictions and medical therapy provides the best chance for preventing the development of new lesions and controlling disease progress.
- Surgical options for management of HS include punch debridement, unroofing of skin tunnels or abscesses, and wide excision.
