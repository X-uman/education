| Method                         | Description                                                                                                                      |

| Sustained Inflation Techniques | - Increase airway pressure to 30–40 cm H2O for 30–40 seconds                                                                     |
|                                | - Followed by a decrease in PEEP                                                                                                 |
|                                | - Amplitude and duration of increased pressure are limited by the risk of hemodynamic compromise and decrease in lung compliance |
| Incremental PEEP Increase      | - Gradual increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)                                                                    |
|                                | - Aimed at recruiting collapsed alveoli and improving oxygenation                                                                |
|                                | - Adjustments should be made cautiously to avoid hemodynamic compromise and barotrauma                                           |
