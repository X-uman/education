| Ataxia                    | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Gait ataxia/Stomping gait | - Abnormal wide-based and unsteady gait; irregular, uncoordinated activity of the muscles of pelvic girdle and/or lower limbs <br>- Unsteadiness that occurs independently of whether the eyes are open or closed ([[Romberg test]] cannot be performed)<br>- [[Unterberger test]]: Positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Truncal ataxia            | - Inability to maintain truncal stability and coordinate central trunk muscles, <br>- which manifests in difficulty sitting upright and/or standing without support; <br>- most apparent in the sitting position<br>- Tendency to fall backwards or sideways<br>- Occurs due to damage to the cerebellar vermis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Limb ataxia               | - The inability to perform coordinated movements with the upper and/or lower extremities<br>- Can manifest with dysmetria: the inability to coordinate the speed and range of a certain movement. The patient tends to overshoot (hypermetria) or miss (hypometria) their target.<br>- Positive finger-to-nose test: patients are unable to touch the tip of their nose with their index finger with eyes closed <br>- Positive heel-knee-shin test: patients are unable to run the heel of one foot down the shin of the other leg, resulting in characteristic zig-zag movements of the foot as a result of excessive corrective movements to counterbalance deviation.<br>- Occurs due to damage to the cerebellar hemispheres |
| [[Degluttition]]          | Incoordination in mouth and throat muscles leads to [[Aspiration Pneumonitis]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
