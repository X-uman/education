### Diagnostics
- [[Wilm's tumor staging and management]] 
#### Management
- Prognosis for children with Wilms’ tumor is defined by the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis and the histologic type (favorable vs. unfavorable). 
- Preoperative chemotherapy is indicated for bilateral involvement, a solitary kidney, or tumor in the inferior vena cava above the hepatic veins. 
- Gross tumor rupture during surgery automatically changes the stage to 3 (at a minimum).
