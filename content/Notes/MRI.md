### Imaging modes

| Imaging Mode                                | Characteristics                       | Applications                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T1** Weighted Image (T1WI)                | Fat appears bright                    | **Anatomical** detail, identification of fat-containing structures                |
| **T2** Weighted Image (T2WI)                | Fluid-filled structures appear bright | Detecting fluid accumulation, identifying **edema**                               |
| Short-Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR)         | Fat suppression, edema highlighted    | Trauma, neoplasms, areas with fat-rich tissues                                    |
| Gradient Echo Imaging                       | High-resolution 3D reconstruction     | Detailed assessment of structures, e.g., bone loss following shoulder dislocation |
| Sagittal Proton Density-Weighted Images     | Detailed tissue structure             | Knee meniscus studies                                                             |
| Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)            | Visualizes cellular edema             | Detecting changes in tissue microstructure, e.g., stroke, tumors                  |
| FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) | Visualizes tissue around ventricles   | Lesion detection near cerebrospinal fluid spaces                                  |
| Diffusion **Tensor** Imaging (DTI)          | Visualizes white matter **tracts**    | Assessing connectivity and integrity of neural pathways                           |


### Contraindications: Magnetic implants

- automatic defibrillators, internal hearing aids, and metallic
- orbital foreign bodies.

### MRI uses
- Anatomy: anomalies
- Pathology
	- Tissue occult edema: Osteomyelitis, Stroke 
	- Tissue ischemia
