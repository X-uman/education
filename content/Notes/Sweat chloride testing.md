### Indications
- Positive newborn screening (NBS)
- First-degree family member with CF, sibling, parent or child
- Typical clinical features of CF (e.g., chronic sinopulmonary disease, gastrointestinal and nutritional irregularities, syndromes of salt loss, obstructive azoospermia)
- To ensure adequate sweat collection, patients should be > 10 days of age, > 36 weeks corrected gestational age, and weigh > 2 kg.

### Results
1. If the sweat test result is greater than or equal to 60 mmol/L, CFTR dysfunction is confirmed.
2. If the age is less than 6 months and the sweat test result is between 30 and 59 mmol/L, proceed to genetic testing.
3. If the age is 6 months or older and the sweat test result is between 40 and 59 mmol/L, proceed to genetic testing.
4. If the sweat test result is borderline and the diagnosis is still unclear, consider physiologic testing (NPD or ICM).
