### Introduction
- [[Alpha thalassemia]]
- [[Beta thalassemia]]

#### Clinical Features
- [[Anemia]] starts from birth
- Anemia is due to impaired [[Hemoglobin synthesis]] as well as 
- increased [[Extravascular Hemolysis]] (in spleen) which can lead to [[Neonatal Jaundice]] ?
- Bone marrow tries to compensate by proliferating in other sites than Medulla of long bones  i.e. [[Extramedullary Hematopoiesis]]

### Investigations
- CBC
- PBS
	- Microcytic hypochromic anemia
	- Target cells due to scrunching of excess cell membrane and [[Basophilic stippling]] 
- High [[Iron indices]]
- Hemoglobin Analysis: Gel [[Electrophoresis]]
	- Alpha Thalassemia
		- Alpha quantity decreased according to severity of disease
	- Beta Thalassemia
		- Beta quantity decreased according to severity of disease
		- for decreased beta: Gamma comes to rescue, HbF is increased rather than decreasing after birth.
		- Increased HbA2 levels 
- Imaging for [[Extramedullary Hematopoiesis]] 
- DNA Analysis: For mutations on genes encoding
	- [[Amniocentesis]] 
#### Management
- Definitive treatment: [[Gene Therapy]], [[Stem cell transplantation]] 
- [[Blood transfusion in thalassemia.png]]
- [[Folic acid (B9)]] and [[Hydroxyurea]] in beta thalassemia 
- [[Splenectomy]] has limited use because risks may outweigh benefits 

### Complications
- Hematological complications of [[Notes/Hemolysis|Hemolysis]] 
- [[Extramedullary Hematopoiesis]] 
- Chronic [[Leg ulcers]] 
- [[Thalassemia in pregnancy]]
