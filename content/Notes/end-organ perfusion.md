### Clinical features of organ hypoperfusion
- A constellation of features seen in tissue hypoperfusion and/or peripheral vasoconstriction (e.g., due to shock). 
- Signs include cold or clammy skin (especially in the extremities); color changes, such as pallor, mottling, and peripheral cyanosis; and delayed capillary refill (> 2 seconds).

- Urine output is a good indicator of kidney perfusion, which is an indicator of overall organ perfusion. 
### Indicator of systemic perfusion
- [[Lactic acidosis]]
- [[base deficit]]
- [[MVOS]]
- [[Contraction alkalosis]] 
- The time to normalization of base deficit, lactate, and  gastric pH is predictive of survival. 
- Observation of at least one of these parameters should be used clinically for prognostication.
- Persistently high base deficit or low pH (or worsening of these parameters) may be an early indicator of complications, e.g., ongoing hemorrhage or abdominal compartment syndrome. These findings should prompt rapid reassessment of the patient.
- Serum bicarbonate levels may be substituted for base deficit levels.

### Indicator of GIT perfusion
- Gastric mucosal pH
- Gut tonometry
- Sublingual capnometry
- Laser flow doplerometry

### Brain/muscles perfusion
- Near infrared spectroscopy
- Tissue Oxygen electrode
