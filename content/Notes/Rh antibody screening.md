### When to do
- RhD typing and an antibody screen are routine performed at the first prenatal visit. 
- In RhD-negative individuals and uncomplicated pregnancy, the antibody screen should be repeated at 28 weeks of gestation and again at delivery.
### Screening for Rh antibodies
| Screening Method                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |

| **Indirect Coombs Test**        | **Procedure:** <br>- Known RhD-positive red blood cells (RBCs) are incubated with maternal plasma.<br> - Maternal anti-D antibodies, if present, adhere to the RBCs.<br> - The RBCs are then washed and suspended in antihuman globulin serum.<br> - Agglutination of RBCs indicates a positive result.                                        |     |
|                                 | **Titer Determination:**<br> - Tube dilutions are set up to report titers ranging from 1 to: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096.<br> - The titer is the highest dilution at which agglutination occurs.                                                                                                               |     |
| **Gel Microcolumn Assay (GMA)** | **Advantages:**<br> - Increased sensitivity<br> - Less susceptibility to variability<br> - Objective and stable results<br> - Less time-consuming and compatible with automation.<br> **Disadvantages:**<br> - No defined critical titer threshold.<br> - Requires validation data for correlation with tube titrations and neonatal outcomes. |     |
| **Comparison**                  | - GMA typically yields higher titer values than tube tests.<br> - GMA results are usually 1.4 to 2 dilutions above tube results.<br> - Consultation with the laboratory is recommended to determine the methodology used for antibody titration.                                                                                               |     |
