### Introduction
- [[CEAP classification]]: C6 disease if active ulceration or CEAP class C5 if healed

---
### Etiology
- [[Post-thrombotic syndrome]] patients can develop ulcer on any part of the calf skin has highest risk of recurrence
- [[Sickle Cell disease]]
- [[Pernicious anemia]]
- [[polycythemia]] is a rare cause of ulceration 

---
### Pathogenesis
- Ambulatory [[Venous hypertension]] 
- [[reactive Oxygen Species]] 

---
### Presentation
- Ulcer frequently occurs just above the ankle
- Itching due to [[Mast cells]] degranulation
- Surrounding [[Hemosiderosis]] which itself may be an important factor in development of ulcer
- Chronic ulcers develop [[lipodermatosclerosis]] 
- Not all ulcers are accompanied by [[Varicose veins]] 
- Other features of [[Chronic venous disease]] are usually present

#### [[Ulcer examination]] 
- Location: Gaiter region: the area between the muscles of the calf and the ankle, this is the region where many of the Cockett perforators join the posterior tibial vein to the surface vein, known was posterior arch vein
- A venous ulcer usually has a gently sloping edge and the floor contains granulation tissue covered by a variable amount of slough and exudate. Any significant elevation of the ulcer edge should indicate the need for a biopsy to exclude a carcinoma (usually a squamous cell)
- Sensation and proprioception should be assess [[Peripheral neuropathy]] especially in diabetic patients
- Look for [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] and [[Osteoarthritis]] 

---
### Diagnostics
- [[Duplex USG]] to assess deep and superficial veins
- Reflux does not confirm venous ulcer but supports diagnosis in absence of other cause 
- CBC, Blood glucose, ESR or C-RP
- [[Sickle Cell disease]] test
- Anemia itself can cause ulcers or can be result of ulceration
- Tissue biopsy is indicated for ulcers with any of the following :
    - No signs of healing after being open continuously for 3 months or after 4â€“6 weeks of standard treatment
    - Worsening despite treatment (e.g., worsening pain, increase in size)
    - Atypical features


---
### Management
- Compression with [[Four-layer bandaging system]] 
- Superficial venous ablation to treat superficial reflux
- Others: 
	- [[Pentoxifylline]] which increases microvascular perfusion by decreasing plasma cellular viscosity and cytokine inhibition
	- Biological dressing
- Antibiotics do not speed ulcer healing 
##### Prevention of recurrence
- Treatment for superficial venous incompetence 
	- Below knee graduated compression stockings for all patients with residual reflux or deep vein occlusion or those with recurrent ulceration. These should be worn for life

### Complications
- [[Marjolin Ulcer]]
