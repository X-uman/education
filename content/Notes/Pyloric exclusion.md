### Indications
- Failed patch repair
- High risk of leakage
- Severe inflammation
- Low patient/tissue health
### Methods
- One common method is to create a gastrotomy along the greater curvature through which the pylorus can be grasped and sutured closed with a nonabsorbable suture. The gastrotomy can then either be closed primarily or used to complete the gastrojejunostomy.
- Another method fires a noncutting stapler across the pylorus, although care must be taken to avoid misfire across the proximal duodenum.
- Pyloric exclusion with a gastrojejunal anastomosis permits continued oral feeding. In most cases, the pyloric closure will open spontaneously within several weeks, by which time the ulcer would have healed.
