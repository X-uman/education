- [[Taenia species]] 
- [[Space Occupying Lesion]] 

### Sites
- Cerebrum
- Subarachnoid space
- Intraventricular

### Pathogenesis
![[Pasted image 20240511231715.png]]

### Presentation
- Commonest: [[Epilepsy]]
- [[Notes/Headache|Headache]] sometimes mimicking [[Migraine]]
- Features of [[meningitis]] 
- [[Features of Raised ICP]]
- Psychiatric disturbances
- [[Cognitive functions]]
- [[Focal neurological deficits]] 
- Features of [[Notes/Hydrocephalus]] 
- Spinal
	- Extramedullary
	- Intramedullary
- [[Ocular cysticercosis]] 
### Diagnostics
- [[Inflammatory markers]]
	- Raised [[Eosinophils]]
- MRI: IOC for Neurocysticercosis
	- Noninvasive MR Cisternography and FLAIR sequences before and after inhalation of 100% O2 may provide better detection of small racemose cisternal cysts 
	- Elevated N-acetyl aspartate and Creatine levels and lactate and, Alanine and succinate in [[MR Spectroscopy]] 
- immunoelectrotransfer blot of [[CSF Analysis]] using lentil lectin Glycoprotein antigens of T. solium cysts 

### Imaging findings

| Stage                  | Characteristics                                                                                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vesicular stage        | - Cysts follow the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal. <br> - T2 hyperintense scolex may be seen. <br> - No edema, and usually no enhancement. |
| Colloidal stage        | - Cysts are hyperintense to the CSF. <br> - There is surrounding edema. <br> - The cyst wall enhances.                           |
| Nodular-granular stage| - The cyst wall thickens and retracts. <br> - There is a decrease in edema. <br> - Nodular or ring enhancement is present.       |

### Histological features
- Racemose: Multiple cysts hanging near cisterns Like Grapes, can produce Hydrocephalus or Canceriform presentation (Infiltration) 
- Cystic: Mostly in Leptomeninges and Cerebral cortex
- Mixed

### Treatment
- Dead parasite: Treat symptoms like epilepsy
	- [[phenytoin]]
	- [[Carbamazepine]]
	- [[Phenobarbital]] 
- American Epilepsy Society, recommends treatment with [[albendazole]] (400 mg BD or 7.5 mg/kg q12hr for 8-30 d
- Praziquantel: 33.3 mg/kg q8hr on day 1, then 16.7 mg/kg q8hr for 29 days 
- plus either dexamethasone or prednisolone to decrease the number of active lesions on brain imaging studies and reduce long-term seizure frequency.
- Surgery: [[Ventricular shunts]] 
- Monitoring: FO Imaging 2-3 months following treatment
