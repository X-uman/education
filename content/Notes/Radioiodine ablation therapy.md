### Indications
- Toxic MNG and toxic adenoma with high nodular radioactive iodine uptake
- Failure to achieve euthyroidism with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) in Graves disease, due to:
	- Refractory disease
	- Contraindications to ATDs, e.g., liver disease
	- Major adverse reactions to ATDs
- High surgical risk due to comorbidities  or previous surgery or radiation of the neck
- Limited life-expectancy
- Other: [[thyrotoxic periodic paralysis]], post-surgical treatment of certain thyroid cancers, large/compressive nontoxic goiters  [31]
### Contraindications
- [[Pregnancy]]
- Toddlers
- Moderate to severe [[Graves ophthalmopathy]] which can be worsened
- Inability to follow up
### Preparation
- Prophylaxis for transient [[Hyperthyroidism]] due to rupture of thyroid follicles from beta rays emitted by Radioactive iodine
	- [[Beta-Blockers]] even in asymptomatic patients
	- Administer Methimazole to rapidly achieve a euthyroid state; must be discontinued 2–3 days before
- Avoid excess [[Iodine]] intake 1 week prior to therapy
- [[Pregnancy]] test should be negative 
#### Procedure
- Single oral dose of iodine-131 → isotope uptake by thyroid gland → emission of beta radiation that slowly destroys the thyroid tissue
### Complications
- Early
	- [[Hypothyroidism]]
	- Nausea/vomiting
	- [[Sialadenitis]] due to Iodine uptake 
	- [[Bone marrow suppression]] temporarily
- later
	- [[Radiation-induced thyroiditis]]
	- Secondary malignancy
	- Leukemia 
	- [[Xerostomia]] due to destruction of salivary glands
