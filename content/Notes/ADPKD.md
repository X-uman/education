### Pathophysiology
- Two-hit hypothesis
- Inherited mutation in one allele of PKD1 (polycystin-1) or PKD2 (polycystin-2) genes 
    - Polycystin-1: involved in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions
    - Polycystin-2: a nonselective cation channel transporting Ca2+
- Additional second somatic acquired mutation in tubule epithelial cells 
- Abnormal cilia-mediated signaling pathways → formation and expansion of cysts in the renal cortex and medulla → compression of renal vessels with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ischemia, and destruction of the kidney parenchyma. 

### Pathology
- Progressive cystic dilatation of the kidney tubular system
- Cystic dilation in other organs such as liver and pancreas
- Left ventricular hypertrophy
- Vascular dolichoectasias (elongations and distention of the arteries caused by weakening of the vessel walls)
- Cardiac valvular abnormalities (e.g., defects of the mitral valve and the aortic root, annulus, and/or valve)

### investigations
-USG 
 - In adults: enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts bilaterally of varying sizes (anechoic masses)
- In children: evidence of cysts in combination with a family history positive of ADPKD
-  Hepatic, pancreatic, and/or splenic cysts may be visible

### Prognosis 
- 50% of ADPKD patients have ESRD requiring dialysis by the age of 60 years
- Chronic hypertension and cerebral aneurysms, in particular, are associated with a poor prognosis.
