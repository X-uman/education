### Secretion

| Process                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secretion of natriuretic peptides | ↑ intracellular smooth muscle cGMP → vasodilation → hypotension and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure → cleavage of the prohormone proBNP into BNP and NT-proBNP  |
| Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)   | - Ventricular myocyte hormone released in response to increased ventricular filling and stretching                                                                           |
| NT-proBNP                         | - Inert biomarker produced in cardiomyocytes from the cleavage of the prohormone proBNP                                                                                      |
### Uses
- Useful for diagnostic confirmation and prognosis
- Should always be interpreted in comparison to the patient's baseline and in the context of history, examination, and imaging
- High diagnostic utility in patients with an unclear diagnosis
- BNP can help exclude AHF in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability (e.g., in patients with a history of both COPD and chronic HF who present with acute respiratory symptoms). Using a cutoff of 100 pg/mL, sensitivity is ∼ 90% and specificity ∼ 75% for the diagnosis of AHF.



- Chronic heart failure unlikely if:
    - BNP is < 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP is < 125 pg/mL in chronic HF
    - BNP is < 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP is < 300 pg/mL in AHF
