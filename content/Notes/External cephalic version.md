- The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends discussing ECV at ≥36 0/7 weeks and performing the procedure at ≥37 0/7 weeks
- ECV appears to be a safe option for patients who present in labor with an unengaged breech presentation, intact membranes, normal amniotic fluid volume, and no contraindications to the procedure
### When not to do?
- Any identified cause of [[Breech presentation]]
- Abnormal pregnancy
- Abnormal fetus 
- Indications for [[Cesarean Section]]

### Pre-procedure
- [[tocolytics]]
- Patient in labor suite 
- [[Antepartum fetal surveillance]] every 2 minutes during procedure

### Procedure
- USG monitoring
- Lift breech from SP
- Apply powder for lubrications
- Version methods
	- Forward somersault
	- Backward somersault
- Discontinue if fetal bradycardia occurs

### Post-procedure
- [[Anti-D Immunoglobulin]] 
- If ECV for breech presentation is unsuccessful or the fetus reverts to breech, one or two retrials of version can be attempted in one or more days.
- For most patients, we do not perform an elective induction immediately after ECV for breech presentation. However, because there is a tendency for a nonlongitudinal (ie, transverse, oblique) lies to recur, after successful ECV of a nonlongitudinal lie, some clinicians perform amniotomy to stabilize the lie, and then induce labor.
### Contraindications
- Absolute indications of [[Cesarean Section]] 
- Relative:
	- Hyperextended head
	- [[IUGR]]
	- [[multiple gestation]] 
	- [[oligohydramnios]]
	- Active labor or rupture of membranes
	- Placental abruption
