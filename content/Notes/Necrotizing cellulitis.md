### Introduction
- Typically caused by anerobic organisms
- Types
	- [[Clostridium]], usually [[Clostridium perfringens]] 
	- Non-clostridial (polymicrobial)
- Crepitus is seen in both cases, but there is sparing of fascia and deep muscles
- Pain, swelling, and systemic toxicity are not prominent features, and the relative mildness helps distinguish cellulitis from clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene) in the immunocompetent host
