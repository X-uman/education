### Introduction
- [[Autosomal recessive]] disease of [[Chromosome 19]]
- Decreased activity of Branch chain alpha keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex which is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in degradation of [[branched chain amino acids]] in liver, so [[Liver transplantation]] for classic disease
- elevated α-ketoacid formation

### Accumulation of 
- Leucine, isoleucine and Valine
- CNS damage: [[Intellectual disability]], [[Dystonia]] 
- Urine odor is due to Isoleucine metabolite
- High branched chain amino acids inhibit transport of [[Tyrosine]], [[Tryptophan]] into CNS leading to decreased Dopamine and Serotonin synthesis (also see [[Phenylketonuria]] treatment)

### Downstream deficiency 
- [[Hypoglycemia]] 

### Types
- Classic
- intermittent: ketoacidosis during episodes of catabolic stress
- Intermediate: Phenylbutyrate, residual BCKDC activity and may become symptomatic at any age
- Thiamine responsive
- E3 Deficient 

### Clinical features
- **Classic MSUD**
	- Symptoms begin < 48 of birth
	- [[Ketonuria]]
	- [[Pediatric non-specific features]] 
	- Eventually develop
		- Seizures
		- Apnea
		- [[Cerebral edema]] 
	- Metabolic intoxication episodes
		- Epigastric pain, Vomiting, anorexia, weakness
		- Due to [[Notes/Metabolic response to injury|Metabolic response to injury]] 

### Diagnostics
- Newborns, infants, and children who present with encephalopathy and ketoacidosis sporadically, intermittently, during episodes of intercurrent illness, or following prolonged fasting or trauma should be tested for MSUD, even in the context of negative newborn screening results
- diagnosis is established by the measurement of plasma amino acid concentrations that demonstrate elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) **and** alloisoleucine (a stereo-isomer of L-isoleucine).
- The identification of elevated **alloisoleucine in plasma is sufficient for a diagnosis of MSUD**; urine studies are not needed in this case.
- However, an increase in alloisoleucine levels may not appear until six days of age, even when leucine levels are elevated. 
- Urine organic acid analysis to detect branched-chain hydro acids and branched-chain keto acids can be used to corroborate the diagnosis during this transient period.
	- urine levels of branched-chain ketoacids, lactate, and pyruvate.
- Detection of plasma **alloisoleucine and 2-oxo-3-methylvaleric acid** with [[High-pressure liquid chromatography]] is also diagnostic for MSUD.
- [[Genetic studies]] 
	- Identification of Genotype informs likelihood of thiamine responsiveness and can be used for prenatal and/or preimplantation diagnosis if future pregnancies are anticipated
- [[Antenatal investigations]] 
	- Measuring enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or choriovillus cells or by mutation analysis if the specific gene defect is known
	- Preimplantation diagnosis is feasible if the pathogenic variants of the index patient are known.
- Neonatal screening: [[Tandem Mass spectrometry]] 
### Management
- [[Thiamine]] supplementation as a cofactor
	- 4 week trial at a dose of 50-200  mg/day
- Avoid foods with BCAA
	- LOW protein diet
	- Plasma leucine concentrations should be maintained between 75 to 200 micromol/L in children under five years of age and between 75 to 300 micromol/L for patients over five years of age to achieve favorable intellectual outcome
- [[Liver transplantation]] in classical variant 
- Monitoring consists of measurement of plasma amino acid concentrations every one to two weeks for the first 6 to 12 months of age.
- Aggressive management of [[Notes/Metabolic response to injury|Metabolic response to injury]]
	- glucose infusions (eg, dextrose 10% and sodium chloride 0.9% [D10NS] at 1 to 1.5 times maintenance)
	- with or without the addition of insulin (add if glucose levels are >130 mg/dL)
	- supplementation with precursor-free amino acid mixture.
	- Hyponatremic cerebral edema should be treated with hypertonic saline, mannitol, and furosemide. 
	- In rare circumstances, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be needed to remove BCAAs and ketoacids and to prevent recurrent clinical intoxication
	- Treatment of urea cycle disorders with sodium phenylacetate/benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate results in a reduction of BCAAs.
