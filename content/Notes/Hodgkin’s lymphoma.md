- Findings on biopsy
	- Commonest: Nodular sclerosing type
	- Best prognosis: Lymphocyte rich HL (Lymphocyte predominant tends to relapse more)
	- Reed-Sternberg Cells
	- Eosinophils: Histamine, IgE: pruritus
	- Macrophages: TNF-alpha 

### Treatment
| Stage                        | Treatment Approach                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Limited-Stage Favorable HL   | Short-courses of chemotherapy + radiation therapy  |
| Limited-Stage Unfavorable HL | Longer courses of chemotherapy +/- radiation       |
| Advanced-Stage HL            | Longer courses of chemotherapy *without* radiation |
##### Chemotherapy
- First-line treatment for all patients is typically ABVD: doxorubicin (Adriamycin), bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine.
- Alternative
	- Stanford V: doxorubicin, vinblastine, mechlorethamine, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, prednisone
	- BEACOPP: bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin (doxorubicin), cyclophosphamide, oncovin (vincristine), procarbazine, prednisone
	- MOPP
##### Radiation
- Indication: individuals with limited-stage HL following chemotherapy 
	- An exception is in patients with NLPHL, who, in some cases, may be treated with radiation alone.
- Radiation should target involved lymph nodes and/or extranodal sites
- More extensive radiotherapy is associated with a higher risk of radiation-related complications, e.g., the development of second cancers. Therefore, radiation that targets areas identified on the PET/CT scan is typically preferred.
- Splenic radiation candidates: additional vaccines as part of infection prevention for asplenia 
##### Other
- [[Stem cell transplantation]] 
- [[Cancer immunotherapy]] 
#### Follow up
- Oncology follow-ups
    - First two years: every 3–6 months
    - Third year: every 6–12 months
    - After four years: annually
- If cancer-free after 5 years, the primary care provider may assume annual follow-up care.
