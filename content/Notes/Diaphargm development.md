#embryology 
### Components of diaphargm
- Septum transversum
	   - Forms at four weeks of gestation as an incomplete diaphragm centrally separating the pleural and peritoneal cavities
	   - Develops into the central tendon of the diaphragm
- Pleuroperitoneal membranes
	   - At the 5th week of gestation, pleuroperitoneal membranes form lateral to the central tendon, on either side.
	   - They fuse with the septum transversum and the mesentery of the esophagus to complete the partition between the pleural and peritoneal cavities.
	   - The left side fuses later, possibly explaining why most CDH are left-sided.
- Dorsal mesentery of the esophagus: develops into the [[diaphragmatic crura]]
- Mesoderm of the body wall: forms the peripheral rim of the diaphragm
