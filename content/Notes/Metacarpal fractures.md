### Classification
| Fracture Type              | Description                                                                                          | Mechanism                                                        | Associated Features                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bennett's Fracture         | Intra-articular fracture at the base of the 1st metacarpal, involving joint surface                  | Axial loading, direct trauma, forced abduction of thumb          | Subluxation or dislocation of first carpometacarpal joint               |
| Reverse Bennett's fracture | At 5th metacarpal's base                                                                             |                                                                  |                                                                         |
| Bennett's Fracture Variant | Unstable fracture at the base of the first metacarpal, involving a small ulnar fragment              | Similar to Bennett's fracture                                    | May result in subluxation or dislocation of first carpometacarpal joint |
| Rolando Fracture           | **Comminuted** extra-articular fracture at the base of first metacarpal with three or more fragments | High-energy trauma, crush injury                                 | Severe instability of first carpometacarpal joint                       |
| Boxer's Fracture           | Fracture at the neck of the fifth metacarpal                                                         | Direct impact, punching                                          | Shortening and angulation of fifth metacarpal                           |
| Other Metacarpal Fractures | Fractures involving shaft or head of thumb metacarpal, excluding Bennett's and Rolando fractures     | Variable, including direct trauma, crush injuries, axial loading | Depends on specific location and pattern of fracture                    |
