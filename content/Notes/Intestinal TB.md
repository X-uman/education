### Pathogenesis
- Commonest site: Distal ileum and ileocecal valve area
- The affinity of M. tuberculosis for this site may be due to the relative stasis and abundant lymphoid tissue in this region. 
- The organism penetrates the mucosa and localizes in the submucosal lymphoid tissue, where it initiates an inflammatory reaction with subsequent lymphangitis, endarteritis, granuloma formation, caseation necrosis, mucosal ulceration, and scarring.
- The macroscopic appearance of the intestinal lesions can be categorized as follows 
	- Ulcerative (60 percent), characterized by multiple superficial ulcers typically in a transverse/circumferential orientation relative to the long axis of the gut lumen.
	- Hypertrophic (10 percent), characterized by scarring, fibrosis, and pseudotumor lesions.
	- Ulcerohypertrophic (30 percent), characterized by an inflammatory mass around the ileocecal valve with thickened and ulcerated intestinal walls. The ulcerohypertrophic form is more commonly observed in ileocecal disease than with TB involving other segments of the gastrointestinal tract.

### Presentation
- The symptoms and signs of gastrointestinal and peritoneal tuberculosis are nonspecific, and the diagnosis may be missed or delayed—resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
- Most patients with abdominal tuberculosis present with symptoms that have lasted from 1 month to 1 year. These patients may present with abdominal pain, wasting, weight loss in general, loss of appetite, fever, diarrhea, constipation, rectal bleeding, and edema. The symptoms are usually of moderate intensity.
- The presence of coexistent pulmonary TB significantly increases the frequency of fever and night sweats, weight loss, and pulmonary symptoms.
- TB may be associated with a number of immune-mediated manifestations such as erythema nodosum, [[erythema induratum or Bazin's disease]], [[Reactive arthritis]] ([[Poncet disease]]) and uveitis, all of which may mimic extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn’s disease

### Diagnosis
- A definitive diagnosis if any of the following: 
	- **Culture**: of tissue (colonic biopsy, lymph nodes) positive for M. tuberculosis 
	- **ZN staining**: typical acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
	- **Histology**: evidence of caseating granuloma 
	- **GeneXpert**: MTB rifampicin (RIF) assay/TB polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done on a biopsy specimen.
### Treatment
- [[Anti-tubercular therapy]] 
	- Patients with tuberculous enteritis generally demonstrate clinical improvement within two weeks on empiric therapy, and in one study, colonoscopic follow-up after two to three months of anti-TB therapy showed complete healing of active ulcers and erosions 
	- In the absence of clinical response, surgical exploration may be warranted to evaluate for alternative diagnoses such as Crohn’s disease, lymphoma, or malignancy
