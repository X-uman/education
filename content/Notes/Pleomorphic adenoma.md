### Introduction
- MCC of benign salivary glands tumors
- MCS Tail of [[Parotid Gland]]
- Other site: [[Submandibular Gland]] 

### Presentation
- ==Females== > males, adults
- Lifts the ear lobule
- Obliterated retromandibular groove
- **Curtain sign**: mobility: Can be move side to side but not up and down
- Bidigital palpation if arises from deep lobe, tonsils pushed medially
- Fingers/Pseudopodia: ==Bosselated== surface on [[Palpation]]
### Diagnostics
- USG: Investigation of choice
- MRI
- Biopsy
	- Mixed tumor: Epithelial and mesenchymal components
	- [[Cytokeratin]] as a [[Tumor Markers]] 
#### Pathology
- Slow growing, capsulated tumor with finger like projections
- Gray-white to myxoid and blue Translucent areas of chondroid tissue 
	-   Epithelial component: form Glands and nests 
	-   Mesenchymal component (product of myoepithelial cells): Cartilage, Bone, Myxoid tissue (Pseudocartilage)

### Management 
 - Superficial [[parotidectomy]]  
 - Both lobes involved: Total parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation 
 - Enucleation: not preferred due to high risk of remnant tissue and recurrence of tumor
 - Radiotherapy after surgery 
- cautions 
	- recurrence common due to incomplete removal, because of finger like projections remaining after operation
	- [[Facial nerve]] can be damaged
	- [[Pseudoencapsulation]] #search

### Complication
- If converted into malignant––malignant mixed tumor or carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma––Adenocarcinomas or Undifferentiated Carcinoma––Very Aggressive
