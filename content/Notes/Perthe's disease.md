### Introduction
- Idiopathic Avascular [[Osteonecrosis]] of femoral head

---
### Etiology
- Idiopathic
- Other factors
	- Child's hyperactivity leading to repeated microtrauma
	- [[thrombophilia]]
	- Second hand smoke exposure 

---
### Pathogenesis
- Avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to a mismatch between the rapid growth of the femoral epiphyses and the slower development of adequate blood supply to the area



----
### Epidemiology
- Occurs in children between 4-10
- M > F 
---
### Clinical presentation  
- Hip pain on weight bearing
Here's the information organized into a tabulated format:

| Clinical Features            | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Antalgic gait                | - Gait pattern characterized by limping or favoring the non-weight-bearing leg due to pain in the weight-bearing leg                                                                      |
| Pain                         | - Located in the hip or upper leg, sometimes projecting to the knee<br>- Insidious onset, pain may fluctuate depending on physical activity<br>- Often exacerbated by internal rotation   |
| [[FABER test]]               | - Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation test might be positive                                                                                                                        |
| Groin tenderness             | - Tenderness in the groin area on palpation                                                                                                                                               |
| Restricted range of movement | - Usually present, especially regarding internal rotation and abduction, leading to a limp                                                                                                |
| [[Hinge abduction]]          | - Refers to the lateral femoral head bumping into the ventrolateral acetabulum when the leg is abducted<br>- May involve pain, a palpable clunk, and restriction in the range of movement |
| Contralateral involvement    | - Present in approximately 10% of cases                                                                                                                                                   |

#### Clinical signs
- [[Antalgic gait]] 

---
### Diagnostics
- Early stages: MRI can detect
- X-ray: can help to determine surgical intervention
- [[Lateral pillar classification]] 
---
### Management
- Principle: Retaining anatomical position of femoral head as much as possible inside [[acetabulum]] 
- Mild: Reduced weight bearing and physical therapy
Here's the information organized into a tabulated format:

| Treatment    | Indications                                                                                                                                           | Indications                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conservative | - Limited weight bearing, physical therapy<br>- Casting and bracing can also be used until femoral head deformity develops or range of motion worsens | - Young children (< 6 years of age)<br>  - Mostly undamaged femoral head<br>  - Lateral pillar A classification                  |
| Surgery      | - Femoral [[osteotomy]]<br>- Hip arthroplasty can be considered in adults that develop [[osteoarthritis]]                                             | - Older children (≥ 6 years of age)<br>  - Extensive damage to the femoral head (> 50%)<br>  - Lateral pillar B/C classification |

---

### Complications
- Early [[osteoarthritis]] of the hip joint due to any of the following: 
	- Incongruence between the femoral head and acetabulum
	- Shortening of the femoral neck  featuring trochanteric elevation, which can manifest as Trendelenburg sign
	- Lateralization and coxa magna (broadening of the femoral head), which can manifest as hinge abduction

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Transient synovitis]]
- [[Septic arthritis]]
- [[Slipped capital femoral epiphysis]] 
- [[Developmental dysplasia of hip]]
