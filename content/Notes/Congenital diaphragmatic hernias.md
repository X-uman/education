### Types
- Left Postero-lateral (Bochdalek hernias)
- Anterior defects (Morgagni hernias) in Foramen of morgagni which present late 
![[Pasted image 20240511214139.png]]
### Presentation
- Can present from minutes-hours or days to weeks and can range from asymptomatic to severe distress
- [[Mass Effect]] in Bochdalek hernia
	- Barrel shaped chest ipsilaterally 
	- [[Respiratory distress]] due to 
		- [[Pulmonary hypoplasia]] 
		- [[Persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn]] is most important prognostic factor 
		- [[Surfactant deficiency]] 
	- [[Mediastinal shift]] to right side
- [[Bowel sounds]] in chest instead of breath sounds
- Possible syndromic dysmorphism 
- Scaphoid abdomen

### Differential diagnosis

| Prenatal                                  | Postnatal                                        |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| - [[Congenital diaphragmatic eventration]]<br>- [[Bronchogenic cysts]]<br>- [[Congenital pulmonary airway malformation]]<br>- [[Pulmonary agenesis]]<br>- [[Mediastinal mass]]<br>- [[Pulmonary sequestration]] | - Other causes of [[Pulmonary hypoplasia]]<br>- Other causes of [[Persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn]] |

### Diagnostics
- [[Antenatal USG]] 
	- Fluid filled stomach/bowel seen in thorax with [[Peristalsis]] 
	- [[Polyhydramnios]] due to [[Esophageal obstruction]] 
	- [[Hydrops Fetalis]] due to compression of great vessels aka [[Obstructive shock]] ?
- CXR
	- Abdominal contents, air/fluid-filled bowel, and poorly aerated lung in the ipsilateral hemithorax 
	- In right-sided CDH: the liver appears as an intrathoracic soft tissue mass + absence of the normal intra-abdominal liver shadow
- Do not attempt [[Pleurocentesis]] if suspected ([[Bowel Perforation]])

### Complications
 - Bowel complications: obstruction, strangulation, incarceration, ileus, ulceration, perforation 
- In infants with Bochdalek-type congenital diaphragmatic hernia, the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia and the resultant pulmonary hypertension are key determinants of survival. Barotrauma and hypoxia should be avoided.
### Management
- Prenatally diagnosed CDH: antenatal glucocorticoids
- Postnatal therapy
- Initial medical resuscitation
   - Correction of hypoxia or acidosis
	   - ==Do not attempt [[Ambu bag ventilation]]== 
	  - Intubation and mechanical ventilation: indicated in all infants with CDH 
	- [[Extracorporeal life support]] (ECLS) who do not improve
- Gastric decompression: insertion of a nasogastric tube and continuous suction
- Inotropic support may be required to maintain blood pressure
- [[Surfactant therapy]]: in infants born < 34 weeks of gestation and x-ray findings suggesting [[Neonatal respiratory distress]] 
- Surgical repair ([[thoracotomy]] or laparotomy)
	- Indicated in all cases of CDH
	- Timing: after the infant is stabilized, often after 24–48 hours 
	- Procedure: reduction of the hernial contents and primary closure of the defect  (If the defect is large, a biomaterial patch (e.g., Gore-tex® patch) can be used to close the defect.)
