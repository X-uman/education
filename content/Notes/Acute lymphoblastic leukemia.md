### FAB Classification
|Subtype|Description|
|---|---|
|L1 ALL|Small cells (20–30%)|
|L2 ALL|Heterogeneous large cells (70%)|
|L3 ALL|Large cells, Burkitt lymphoma (1–2%)|
### WHO classification
- B lymphoblastic leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities
	- ALL with BCR-ABL
	- ALL with t(v;11q23)
	- ALL with t(1;19)(q23;p13.3)
	- ALL with t(12;21)(p13;q22)
	- Hyperdiploid > 50
	- Hypodiploid
	- t(5;14)(q31;q32)
- B lymphoblastic leukemia, not otherwise specified
- Precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma

- B-ALL is usually positive for:
	- CD10 (CALLA): marker for immature B lymphocytes (pre-B)
	- CD19
	- CD20
- T-ALL is usually positive for CD2–CD8, especially CD3

### Immunophenotypic classification
| Subtype              | Description                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| B-cell ALL           |                                    |
| - Early (pro-B) ALL  |                                    |
| - Common ALL         | Precursor B-ALL                    |
| - Mature B-cell ALL  | Also known as [[Burkitt leukemia]] |
| T-cell ALL           |                                    |
| - Early (pro-T) ALL  |                                    |
| - Intermediate-T ALL |                                    |
| - Mature T-cell ALL  |                                    |
