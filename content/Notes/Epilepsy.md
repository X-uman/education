### Definition
- Tendency to develop seizures defined as
	- 2 unprovoked/reflex seizures 24 h apart
	- One unprovoked/reflex seizure in an individual with at least 60% chance of developing seizure within next 10 years
		- Traumatic brain injuries
		- Stroke
		- CNS infections
	- Diagnosis of [[epilepsy syndromes]] 
- [[Seizure Classification.webp]] 

### Classification
- [[Focal onset seizures]]
- [[Generalized onset seizures]] 
- Combined
	- [[Dravet syndrome]] 
	- [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] 
- Unknown e.g. Epileptic spasms
- Unclassified due to inadequate information or inability to categorize 

### Approach of patient with seizure
- Describe the seizure: [[Seizure graph.png]]
- Classify the seizure
- Consider [[epilepsy syndromes]] 
- Past history of seizure, if present, it is probably epilepsy and anti-antileptic drugs is need
- First seizure: can be considered epilepsy
- Clinical examination
- EEG findings may help to diagnose [[epilepsy syndromes]] 
- EEG-telemetry in hospitalized patients
- Evaluate for underlying causes of [[Seizures]] 

### Management
- During seizure
	- Lateral decubitus
	- Do not attempt put finger into their mouth
	- Oxygen mask 
	- Remove risky objects from vicinity
	- Take blood and check glucose, open IV line 
	- Check vitals
	- ABCDE assessment
	- Observe time duration of seizure to manage [[Status Epilepticus]]

- [[Drug-resistant epilepsy]] 
- [[Epilepsy in pregnancy]] 

### Differential diagnosis of epilepsy
- [[Febrile seizures]] 
- [[Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures]] 
- [[Panic attacks]]
- [[Syncope]] 
- [[Stroke]] 
- [[Migraine]] aura 
- [[Breath holding spells]]
- [[Self-stimulatory behavior]]
- [[Masturbation in children]] 

### Complications
| **Acute**                                                         | **Chronic**                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Hyperthermia** <br> Excitatory toxicity <br> [[Post-ictal period]]: [[Lactic acidosis]] <br> **Trauma:** <br> - [[Shoulder dislocation]] posteriorly <br> - Tongue bite <br> [[Status Epilepticus]] | Psychiatric illnesses <br> Sleep disturbances <br> Drug effects: Mainly bone related <br> Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy |
