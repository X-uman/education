- sudden elevations in systemic blood pressure exceed the normal cerebrovascular auto-regulatory capacity (Hauser, 1988; Schwartz, 2000). 
- Regions of forced vasodilation and vasoconstriction develop, especially in arterial boundary zones. 
- At the capillary level, disruption of end-capillary pressure causes increased hydrostatic pressure, hyper-perfusion, and extravasation of plasma and red cells through endothelial tight-junction openings.
- mean arterial pressures that exceed limits of autoregulation—approximately 160 mm Hg.
- there is no consistent evidence that acute reductions of systolic blood pressure to a more aggressive target than 140–179 mmHg improves functional outcome
