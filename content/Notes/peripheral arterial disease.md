### Epidemiology

### Clinical features
| Stage | Clinical Presentation      | Management/description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I     | Asymptomatic               | No symptoms reported; disease is typically discovered incidentally or during routine examination.                                                                                                                          |
| II    | [[Claudication]]           | Further divided into IIa (painless walking distance of ≥ 200 m) and IIb (painless walking distance of < 200 m)<br>Perform a comprehensive history and physical examination.  <br>Measure [[Ankle brachial pressure index]] |
| III   | [[Critical limb ischemia]] | Perform a comprehensive history and physical examination.  <br>Measure [[Ankle brachial pressure index]]                                                                                                                   |
| IV    | [[Acute limb ischemia]]    | consult vascular surgery immediately for urgent revascularization, management depends upon [[Rutherford staging]]                                                                                                          |
### Management
- See Claudication, Critical limb ischemia and acute limb ischemia
- Disease progression prevention strategies
	- [[Lifestyle modifications]]: Smoking cessation, weight reduction
	- [[Lipid lowering drugs]]
	- [[Antiplatelet agents]]
	- [[Anti-hypertensive drugs]]
	- [[Diabetes Mellitus]] treatment
### Complications
- [[Arterial ulcers]] 
- [[Gangrene]]
