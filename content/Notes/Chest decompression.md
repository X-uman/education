- Emergency needle thoracostomy, followed immediately by chest tube placement 
- Consider a finger thoracostomy if needle thoracostomy is unsuccessful

### Needle decompression
- Immediate insertion of a large-bore needle
- In adults: use the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line or the 4thâ€“5th intercostal space between the anterior and midaxillary line (especially in muscular or obese patients) 
- In children: use the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line
- Typically followed by the insertion of a chest tube
- Old: Wide bore e.g. 16G cannula MCL at 2nd ICS
- New [[ATLS]]: 
	- Adults: 5th ICS at MAL
	- Children: 2nd ICS at MCL
	- #definite Intercostal drainage tube at 5th ICL at MAL
### Finger thoracostomy
- Indications
	- Tension pneumothorax with unsuccessful needle decompression
	- Traumatic cardiac arrest
- Procedure
	- Initial steps: identical to chest tube placement 
	- Difference compared to chest tube placement
		- A gloved finger is inserted into the pleural space to create an open pneumothorax.
		- No chest tube is inserted or secured.
