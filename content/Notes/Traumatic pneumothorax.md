- The treatment of unstable or high-risk traumatic pneumothorax (e.g., tension pneumothorax) is identical to the treatment of unstable spontaneous pneumothorax: emergency chest decompression.
- Consider observation only in hemodynamically stable patients with small pneumothoraces.  [25]
- A chest tube is required for all patients with any of the following:
	- Suspected or proven hemopneumothorax
	- Ongoing or anticipated mechanical ventilation
	- Moderate to large pneumothorax
	- Small pneumothorax with hemodynamic instability
	- Suspected hemopneumothorax: Use a large-bore chest tube.
- Significant chest trauma: Assess for other thoracic injuries, e.g., rib fractures, pulmonary contusions (see “Management of trauma patients”).
