## Types
- Total
- Partial/Antral: distal stomach is resected
	- Antrectomy or partial gastrectomy would remove antral G cells but not parietal cells. To remove all of the gastrin-producing antral tissue, it is necessary to resect at least 35 percent of the distal stomach.
- Subtotal: Cardia and fundus are remaining
	- If a partial gastric resection removes greater than 75 percent of the stomach, it is a subtotal gastrectomy. 
	- Subtotal gastrectomy removes both antral G cells and reduces much of the parietal cell mass.
	- In older adults, antral tissue extends to within 2 cm of the gastroesophageal junction. Thus, the line of resection for a high-lying type I gastric ulcer should be taken high onto the lesser curve. In younger patients, the line between antrum and corpus is more distal. It is not difficult to distinguish antrum from corpus, as the rugae in the antrum are linear and longitudinally oriented, while the rugae in the corpus and fundus are obliquely and more transversely oriented.
