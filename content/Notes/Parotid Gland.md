#### Anatomy
Capsules: Outer false capsule and inner true capsule
	False: Formed by [[investing fascia]]: Superficial and deep parts
	Superficial: Attached to lower border of [[Zygomatic arch]] and masseter fasica forming parotido-masseter fascia
Shape: Inverted pyramidal
	Base: Concave and related to [[External auditory meatus]]
	Apex: directed below and appears in [[Carotid triangle]]
	Superficial surface: [[Layers of body wall]], Greater auricular nerve and superficial parotid lymph nodes
	Medial
		Anteromedial: [[Mandible complex]]
		Posteromedial: [[Carotid Complex]], [[mastoid complex]], [[Styloid apparatus]] 
Structures passing through
	The parotid gland is bisected by the [[Facial nerve]], dividing the gland into superficial and deep lobes.
	retromandibular vein
	external carotid, the latter bifurcates into its terminal branches the superficial temporal and maxillary artery.
##### Parotid duct
The parotid duct exits the gland from its anterolateral surface and crosses over the masseter. As the duct travels across the masseter, it may have small pieces of glandular tissue attached to it. These are accessory parts of the parotid gland.
After travelling over the masseter, the parotid duct pierces the buccinator entering the oral cavity opposite the 2nd maxillary molar tooth. On  #examination the stoma of the duct is normally difficult to see, but may become more apparent or bleed in the presence of pathology of the gland.
Structures pierced by parotid duct
	Buccal pad of fat
	[[Buccopharyngeal fascia]]
	Buccinator
	Mucous membrane of vestibule of mouth

#### Boundaries
**anterior boundary** of the parotid gland abuts not only the ramus of the [[mandible]], but also the medial pterygoid medially and laterally the parotid gland also partially covers the masseter.
The [[mastoid complex]] forms most of the **posterior boundary** with the external auditory meatus in a posterosuperior position relative to the gland.
The zygomatic arch forms the superior boundary. Inferiorly the gland may extend into the upper part of the neck, overlapping the posterior belly of digastric.

#### Relations
gland does come into contact with the superior [[constrictor of the pharynx]], thus swelling of the parotid gland may be noticed in the oropharynx.
**Posteromedial**: [[Carotid Complex]], [[mastoid complex]] and [[Styloid apparatus]]
Anteromedial: [[Medial pterygoid muscle]] 

#### Vascular Supply
**Artery**: External [[Carotid Artery]] branches (posterior auricular and superficial temporal arteries) which form branches within Parotid gland itself
**Vein**: [[retromandibular vein]] formed by union of superficial temporal and maxillary veins.
**Lymphatics**: deep and superficial parotid lymph nodes, to deep cervical chain nodes, then respective jugular trunks into either the thoracic or right lymphatic duct. superficial parotid lymph nodes also drain lymph from the lateral aspect of the eye (not the globe of the eye) and the lateral aspect of the scalp.

#### Nerve supply
Sensory innervation: auriculotemporal nerve (gland) and the great auricular nerve (fascia).
Motor: 
	Parasympathetic: Otic ganglion
		Preganglionic: [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]]
		Postganglionic: Auriculotemporal nerve (From [[Trigeminal nerve]]
	Sympathetic: Fibers of [[Superior cervical ganglion]] travelling along External [[Carotid Artery]]![[Pasted image 20230509145631.png]]
