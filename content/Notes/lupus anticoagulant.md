### Diagnosis
detection involves a three-step procedure

##### Step 1. Screening for phospholipid-dependent coagulation with either:
1. Prolonged [[Partial thromboplastin time]] 
2. Prolonged dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT), which activates intrinsic [[secondary hemostasis]]. It is more sensitive and specific 

##### Step 2. [[Mixing study]]: The patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma (which contains clotting factors).
- aPTT or dRVVT normalize: Presence of lupus anticoagulant ruled out; prolonged aPTT may be due to a lack of clotting factors. e.g. [[Hemophilia]] 
- aPTT or dRVVT remain prolonged: Lupus anticoagulant may be present.

##### Step 3. Confirmation of phospholipid dependence: Phospholipid is added.
- aPTT or dRVVT normalize: Presence of lupus anticoagulants is confirmed.
- aPTT or dRVVT remain prolonged: Consider a factor deficiency.
