### Introduction
- Traumatic or atraumatic
	- Traumatic: Penetrating or blunt (majority)
		- Blunt: [[Acceleration deceleration injury]] leading to crushing and [[shear force]] 
		- Penetrating: Often associated with other injuries to [[Penetrating abdominal injury]] 
	- Atraumatic: Spontaneous or iatrogenic 
		- Spontaneous: rare
			- Coagulopathies
			- [[Angiomyolipoma]] 
			- [[Renal cell carcinoma]]
			- [[Pseudoaneurysm]] 
		- Iatrogenic: PCI, Endovascular procedures whose risk is increased in females, arterial puncture above level of [[inguinal ligament]] and having coagulopathy 
- Occult or signification bleeding
- Significant: [[Hemorrhagic shock]] 

- Epidemiology: Most common cause of unexpected mortality after diagnostic or interventional [[cardiac catheterization]] 

### Clinical features
- Often asymptomatic esp. in atraumatic hematoma 
- Supra-inguinal tenderness and fullness
- Sudden flank or back pain with hemodynamic instability
- [[Primary survey]]
- Look for [[pelvic fractures]] 
- Back injury: suspect renal/vascular injury 
- Grey turner sign: not specific
- Hematoma compresses femoral nerve: [[Femoral neuropathy]] 

### Diagnostics
- [[CECT]] abdomen is the best modality of investigation
- [[FAST scan]] is not unreliable
- Prompt diagnosis is a priority: CT with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis in hemodynamically stable patients or sonography in unstable patients
- Other investigations 
	- CBC, RFT, LFT, Coagulation, Pancreatic markers

### Treatment
- Atraumatic: 
	- Predominantly supportive treatment: careful monitoring, fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, and normalization of coagulation factors if abnormal
	- Tranexamic acid
- Surgical repair 
    - Endovascular management options like intra-arterial embolization or stent-grafts to stop the bleeding
    - [[Exploratory laparotomy]] 
	    - Penetrating injury
	    - Expansile hematoma
	    - Persistent hemodynamic instability
- Zone based management of traumatic RPH, see [[Retroperitoneal zones]] 

### Complications
- [[Hemorrhagic shock]]
- [[Anemia]]
- Infection
- [[Abdominal compartment syndrome]]
