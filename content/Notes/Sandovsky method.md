The Sadovsky method, also known as the "Sadovsky kick count," is another approach to monitoring fetal movements during pregnancy. Here’s how it works:

### Sadovsky Method for Counting Fetal Movements
1. **Choose a time when the baby is usually active.** This is often after a meal.
2. **Lie down on your left side** or sit comfortably with your feet up.
3. **Count every distinct fetal movement** (kicks, rolls, flutters, or swishes) over a specific period, usually 1 hour.
4. **Record the number of movements.**

#### Guidelines:
- The normal expectation is to feel at least 4 movements in 1 hour.
- If fewer than 4 movements are felt, continue counting for an additional hour.
- If there are still fewer than 4 movements in the 2-hour period, contact your healthcare provider.

### When to Seek Medical Advice:
- If you count fewer than 4 movements in 1 hour and fewer than 10 movements in 2 hours.
- If there is a significant decrease in the usual pattern of fetal movements.
- If you have concerns about the baby’s movements at any time.

The Sadovsky method helps expectant mothers keep track of their baby’s activity, providing reassurance of the baby's well-being and allowing for timely medical consultation if there are any concerns.
