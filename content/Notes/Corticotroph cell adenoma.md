- Commonest cause of Endogenous [[Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome)]],
- F>>M, Young Adults, 70% of cases,
- Aka Cushing Disease

### Pathology
- Gross:
	- Pituitary--Crooke Hyaline Change-- High Endo/Exogenous Cortisol--> Normal Granular, Basophilic Cytoplasm of Corticotrophs Becomes homogenous and Paler due to deposition of Intermediate Keratin Filaments in Cytoplasm, seen in PAS staining
	- PAS Positive due to Presence of Proopiomelanocortin(POMC)(ACTH precursor), also show immunoreactivity to POMC, ACTH, B-endorphin
	- Large Adenomas(destructive) in Pituitary after Surgical Removal of Adrenal Glands in Cushing's Syndrome leads to Nelson Syndrome, caused due to absence of Inhibitory effect of Adrenal Hormones on Preexisting Microadenomas--> No Hypercortisolism but Hyperpigmentation(ACTH affecting Melanocytes)
- Adrenals
	- Diffuse Hyperplasia--Bilaterally enlarged glands,
	- up to 30 gm,
	- CS: Yellowish
	- Micro:
		- compact, eosinophilic Lipid Poor ZR cells
		- surrounded by Vacuolated Lipid Rich ZF cells
