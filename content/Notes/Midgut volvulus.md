### management
- Although malrotation with midgut volvulus occurs most commonly within the first few weeks of life, it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in a child with bilious emesis. 
- Volvulus is a surgical emergency; therefore, in a critically ill child, prompt surgical intervention should not be delayed for any reason.
