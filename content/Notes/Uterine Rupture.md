### Causes
 - Excessive pressure inside uterus
	 - [[Distended uterus]] 
	   - [[Precipitate labor]] 
	   - [[augmentation of labor]] leading to [[Uterine hyperstimulation]] 
	   - [[placental abruption]] 
	   - [[Obstructed labor]] 
 - Weakened uterus
	- Scar 
		-  [[Classical CS]]
		- [[Myomectomy]]
		- [[Hysterotomy]] scar
		- Previous [[Uterine curettage]] 
	- [[Abnormal Uterus]]  
### Clinical features
- Impending rupture: increased pain and contraction, tenderness at the lower abdomen
- increased contractions are often followed by a sudden pause in contractions after sense of something giving away at the height of contractions 
- Loss of [[Fetal station]]
- Palpable fetal parts through the rupture
- [[Hypovolemic shock]]: [[Concealed hemorrhage]] into [[Peritoneal cavity]] 
- [[Fetal distress]]: Earliest and Most sensitive sign: prolonged [[Fetal Heart Rate]] deceleration on [[Non-stress Test]] 
- bleeding and pain are unlikely findings?
- LUS dehiscence is commonest findings
- Wound may extend to bladder or uterine vessels 
- Even mild hemodynamic instability in any postpartum patient should prompt consideration of uterine rupture and intraabdominal bleeding, even if vaginal bleeding is not excessive. 
- Hematuria may occur if the rupture extends into the bladder. 
- Maternal symptoms of hypovolemia that appear to be out of proportion to the observed blood loss and abdominal distention should also prompt consideration of intraabdominal hemorrhage.
- Posterior rupture is more common in the unscarred uterus than the scarred uterus. 
- When laparotomy is performed, a posterior rupture is not readily observed upon entering the abdomen so the entire uterus needs to be inspected carefully.
### Management
- Stop [[Oxytocin]]
- [[Primary survey]] 
- Emergency [[Exploratory laparotomy]] and [[Cesarean Section]] within 30min
- repair if possible 
- [[Hysterectomy]] if [[Notes/shock]], [[hemorrhage]] or uterus beyond repair
- Recurrence prevention: Subsequent CS before [[labor]] at or just before [[term]]
