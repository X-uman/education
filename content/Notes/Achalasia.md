### Introduction


---
### Etiology
- Primary: unknown
- Secondary (pseudo-achalasia)
	- [[Chagas disease]] 
	- [[Gastric Carcinoma]]
	- [[Tissue Infiltration]]
	- [[neurofibromatosis]]
	- [[Eosinophic esophagitis]]
	- [[MEN Syndrome]], type 2B
	- Juvenile [[Sjogren's syndrome]]
	- Chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction
	- [[Anderson-Fabry disease]] 
---
### Pathogenesis
- Swallowing is controlled through excitatory (acetylcholine, substance P) and inhibitory (NO, VIP) neurohumoral substances.
- Atrophy of inhibitory neurons in the Auerbach plexus → lack of inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g., NO, VIP) → inability to relax and increased resting pressure of the LES, as well as dysfunctional peristalsis → esophageal dilation proximal to LES

----
### Epidemiology


---
### Presentation
- Dysphagia to solids and liquids; can be progressive  or paradoxical dysphagia (difficulty swallowing liquids, while solids are easily swallowed)
- Regurgitation
- Retrosternal pain and cramps
- Weight loss

#### Clinical signs


---
### Diagnostics
- Suspicion of Achalasia 
	- Dysphagia to solids and liquids
	- Heartburn unresponsive to a trial of proton pump inhibitor therapy
	- Retained food in the esophagus on upper endoscopy
	- Unusually increased resistance to passage of an endoscope through the esophagogastric junction
- [[esophageal manometry]]: Test of choice
	- Uncoordinated or absent in lower thirds
	- Incomplete or absent LES relaxation
	- High LES resting pressure
	- No evidence of mechanical obstruction
- [[Barium study]] 
	- Bird-beak appearance 
- [[Endoscopic ultrasound]] 
- Functional lumen imaging probe
- Chest X-ray
	- [[Mediastinal mass]]
	- Air-fluid level on lateral view 
---
### Management
- If low surgical risk
	- Plummer's Pneumatic dilatation
	- Negus hydrostatic dilatation 
	- LES myotomy/Heller's 
	- Per-oral endoscopic myotomy
	- Transhiatal total esophagectomy where myotomy has failed or when there is mega-esophagus or metaplasia
- If high surgical risk
	- Botulinum toxin injection in LES
	- Other measures are unsuccesful
		- Nitrates
		- [[Calcium Channel blockers]] 
---

### Complications
- Without treatment, patients with achalasia can develop progressive dilation of the esophagus. 
- Late- or end-stage achalasia is characterized by esophageal tortuosity, angulation, and severe dilation or megaesophagus (diameter >6 cm).
- [[Aspiration]]
