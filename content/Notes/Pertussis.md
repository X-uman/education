### Etiology
- Causative Agent: [[Bordetella pertussis]]
- Age affected: 5 months - 5 years
- Incubation: 1 week 
### Pathophysiology
- Proliferation of Bordetella pertussis on ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory mucosa → production of virulence factors (e.g., tracheal cytotoxin) → paralysis of respiratory epithelium cilia and inflammation → secretion of inflammatory exudate into respiratory tract → compromise of small airways → cough, pneumonia, cyanosis 
- Bordetella pertussis produces pertussis toxin → ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of Gi protein → inhibition of Gi protein → adenylate cyclase disinhibition → cAMP accumulation → impaired cell signaling pathways
- Pertussis toxin is responsible for most of the systemic manifestations associated with whooping cough (e.g., hypoglycemia, lymphocytosis, modulation of host immune response).
- Neither vaccination nor actual infection confers complete or lifelong immunity.
