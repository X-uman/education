Causative Agent: [[Corynebacterium Diphtheriae]]

### Clinical Features:
 - Acute onset of Fever, malaise, headache
 - Commonest site of infection: Fauces or Tonsillopharyngeal area (See [[Membrane over tonsils]])
 - Exudates coalesce to form grayish white pseudo membrane extending to surrounding areas which is the hallmark of the disease. Fatal [[Airway obstructions]] can occur if its piece gets dislodged
 - [[Cervical lymphadenopathy]] enlarged leading to bull neck appearance
 - Sore throat, [[Dysphagia]], Muffled voice
 - Nasal Diphtheria: Unilateral/Bilateral Serosanguinous discharge from nose and excoriation of the upper lip
 - Laryngotracheal: Brassy cough, [[Stridor]] and Respiratory Distress
 - Occasionally on skin and conjunctiva

### Complications
- Respiratory Failure due to Occlusion by membrane
- [[Myocarditis]] generally occurs by 2nd week of illness and lead to CCF, Arrythmias, Sudden cardiac death
- Palatal Palsy in 2nd week: Nasal twang and nasal regurgitation
- Ocular palsy in 3rd week
	- Loss of Accommodation: Visual blurring and inability to read
	- Generalized Polyneuritis by 3rd to 6th week
- Renal: [[AKI.canvas|AKI]] 
- Cutaneous diphtheria rarely cause complications

### Diagnosis:
- DD of [[Membrane over tonsils]] 

### Management
 - Most important: #todo/Study do [[Diphtheria Antitoxin]] IV/IM ASAP even earlier than bacteriological confirmation because degree of protection is inversely related to duration of clinical illness. If improvement is sub-optimal, repeat dose may be given
 - Antibiotics: Penicillin G/Erythromycin
 - Active Immunization
 - Other measures
	 - Bed rest for 2-3 weeks
	 - [[Tracheostomy]] if needed
	 - Avoid sudden exertion
	 - Heart Rate and Rhythm monitoring
	 - Palatal Palsy--> Nasogastric feeding
	 - Generalized weakness due to Polyneuritis treated as for [[Poliomyelitis]] or [[Guillian-Barre Syndrome]] 

### Prevention
 - Isolation of the patient until 2 successive culture are negative
 - Disinfection of contaminate articles
 - Household contact observation for development of lesions and chemoprophylaxis with Oral Erythromycin for 7 days or single dose benzathine penicillin.
 - Previously immunized patients should be given booster dose
