### Risk factors
- nonmolar abortion or pregnancy
- may be diagnosed several months or even years after the pregnancy
- time interval from antecedent pregnancy is highly prognostic for PSTT
- A key difference between PSTT and invasive mole or choriocarcinoma is that it secretes very low levels of hCG
- associated with less vascular invasion, necrosis, and hemorrhage than choriocarcinoma. 
- In addition, unlike choriocarcinoma, PSTT tends to remain localized in the uterus for long periods before metastasizing to regional lymph nodes or other metastatic sites

### Diagnostics
- they are usually diploid and monomorphic
- show no chorionic villi and are characterized by a proliferation of mononuclear intermediate trophoblast cells with oval nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm
- Low hCG production
- PSTT may be characterized by an elevated free beta-subunit to total hCG ratio or percent 

- Confined to uterus
- Absent syncytiotrophoblast
- Human placental lactogen
- Less sensitive to chemo
- Hysterectomy or partial may be done
