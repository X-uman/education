**Pascal's Law:**

Pascal's law states that when there is an increase in pressure at any point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other point in the container. This pressure is transmitted undiminished in all directions throughout the fluid, allowing for hydraulic systems to function effectively. Pascal's law forms the basis for various applications in engineering, including hydraulic machines, brakes, and lifts.
Pascal's law can be expressed mathematically as:

𝑃=𝑃<sub>0</sub>+𝜌𝑔ℎ

Where:

- 𝑃 is the pressure at any point in the fluid,
- 𝑃<sub>0​</sub> is the pressure at the reference point (usually the surface),
- 𝜌 is the density of the fluid,
- 𝑔 is the acceleration due to gravity, and
- ℎ is the depth or height of the fluid column from the reference point.
