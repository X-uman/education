### Etiologies
- [[Hypercholesteremia]] 
- Rapid weight loss, Obesity
- [[Clofibrate]] 

### Pathogenesis
- Supersaturated Bile with [[Cholesterol]] 
- [[Gall Bladder Hypomotility]] and [[Cholestasis]]
- Nucleation of Crystals inside GB
- Promoted by: 
	- micro precipitates of Ca Salts, 
	- Hypersecretion of Mucus into GB 
- abnormal hepatic [[cholesterol metabolism]] → 
	- ↑ cholesterol concentration in bile ([[Lithogenic bile]])  and ↓ [[bile salts]] and [[lecithin]] → hyper-saturated bile → precipitation of cholesterol and calcium carbonate → cholesterol stones or mixed stones 
### - Gross: 
- Found Only in [[gallbladder]], Pale Yellow, Round/Ovoid to finely Granular/multifaceted
- CS––Glistening, radiating crystalline palisade
- High [[CaCO3]], P04, Bilirubin––Color becomes Gray-white to black, lamellated
- Multiple, several cm diameter, faceted due to apposition
- **Radiolucent** if made of pure cholesterol
	- CaCO3 presence renders them radiopaque

### Clinical features
- Fat, forty, fertile, female
