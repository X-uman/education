### Indications
- First-line diagnostic test for nonacute PAD (i.e., intermittent claudication, rest pain, or CLI)  [11]
### Technique
- Ask the patient to rest in the supine position for approx. 10 minutes.
- Place the blood pressure cuffs on the ankles and the arms. 
- Locate the pulse using the Doppler.
- Inflate the cuff until the pulse is no longer audible on the Doppler device, and then inflate the cuff by a further 20 mm Hg.
- Deflate the cuff slowly, and note the pressure at which the pulse is audible again.
- Ankle pressure
	- Measure systolic pressure of bilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries.
	- Note the higher systolic pressure of either the dorsalis pedis or the posterior tibial artery of each leg.
- Brachial pressure
	- Measure systolic pressure of bilateral brachial arteries. 
	- Note the higher brachial blood pressure of either arm.
- Calculate the ABI for each leg: Divide the highest ankle pressure by the highest brachial pressure.
### Classification
| Resting ABI | Interpretation                                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| > 1.4       | Medial calcific sclerosis with noncompressible vascular wall (in elderly patients) |
| 1–1.4       | Normal                                                                             |
| 0.91–0.99   | Borderline                                                                         |
| ≤ 0.9       | Abnormal                                                                           |
### Exercise ABI 
- Description: ABI testing following extended exercise of the lower extremity 
- Indication: suspicion of PAD in a patient with a normal or borderline ABI
