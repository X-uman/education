### Notes
Active forms: flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)

### Functions
- FAD and FMN are cofactors for enzymes that are involved in redox reactions (chemical reactions in which electrons are transferred from one substance to another), including:
	- Succinate dehydrogenase (TCA cycle)
	- FAD is part of glutathione reductase (GR) in erythrocytes: NADPH binds to GR → reduction of FAD to FADH- → FADH- breaks disulfide bond in GSSG → GSR can be reduced
### Clinical features
- Corneal vascularization
- Cheilitis, glossitis, stomatitis, pharyngitis 
- Normocytic normochromic anemia
- [[Seborrheic dermatitis]]

### Diagnostics
- Erythrocyte glutathione reductase assay: identifies subtle deficiencies
- Erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient: the activity coefficient (AC) of glutathione reductase is measured in the presence and absence of FAD
