### Introduction
- Spreading inflammation of deeper dermis, subcutaneous and fascial tissues

---
### Etiology
- [[Streptococcus pyogens]] 
- Risk factor: [[immunocompromised status]] 

---
### Pathogenesis
- Bacteria produces streptokinase and hyaluronidase to spread 
- Can be superficial or deep

---
### Presentation
- Common in face, lower limb, scrotum
- Red, shiny area with stretched warm skin
- Tender [[Lymphadenopathy]] may be present
- no edge, no pus, no fluctuation and no limit
- Signs of Septicemia
- Can lead to local gangrene, pus collections 
- Extensive necrosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue: [[Necrotizing soft tissue infections]] 
- [[Erysipelas]] vs cellulitis
	- Clearly demarcated raised border in erysipelas
	- Negative Millian ear sign in cellulitis(See [[Erysipelas]] )

### Diagnostics
- Clinical diagnosis 

---
### Management
- Cellulitis and erysipelas can both cause rapidly progressive and severe illness
- Indications of hospitalization
	- [[Toxic shock syndrome]]
	- Necrosis
	- Joint involvement
	- Vascular graft involvement
	- [[Pyomyositis]]
	- [[Gas gangrene]]
	- [[Deep vein thrombosis]]
	- [[Compartment syndrome]]
- Indications of parenteral therapy
	- Signs of [[qSOFA]]
	- Rapid progression (e.g. doubling size in 24 h)
	- Extensive Erythema
	- High risk [[Neutropenia]] 
	- Unable to tolerate oral therapy
	- [[Lymphangitis]] accompanying cellulitis
