### Increased intake
- High potassium diet
- K containing IV fluid 

### Increased production
- Cellular breakdown in massive scale
	- Massive [[Notes/Hemolysis]]
	- [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
	- [[Tumor lysis syndrome]] 
	- Massive trauma
	- Massive ischemia/infraction
- Increased shift from cells
	- [[Seizures]] 
	- [[Insulin deficiency]] mostly [[Type 1 DM]] 
	- Acidosis
	- potassium leakage during storage (rises by1 mEq/day, Irradiation can increase this rate to 1.5 mEq/day.) in blood traunsfusion 
### Decreased removal
- Defective Kidney
	- [[AKI.canvas|AKI]]
	- [[CKD]]
- RAAS not functioning sufficiently
	- [[Beta-Blockers]]
	- [[ACE-inhibitors]] 
	- [[ARBs]] 
	- [[Potassium sparing diuretics]] 
- [[Acidosis]] 

### Pathophysiology
- Decreased potassium gradient across the cell
- K takes longer time to go out of the cells:
	- Cell takes longer to repolarizes
	- Cell may go into depolarization easily due to increased resting potential i.e. cells become unstable for action potential 
- Cells become unresponsive and unstable 

### Clinical presentation
- Muscle weakness 
- Paralysis
- Decreased sensation/ [[Parasthesias]]
- Decreased tone
- Decreased reflex
- [[Heart block]]
- [[Ventricular fibrillation]] 

### Diagnostics
- Measure serum Potassium: Do [[RFT]] 
- [[Hemolytic markers]]
- [[Muscle Breakdown Markers]]  
- [[RFT]], Renal USG, Pyelograms
- [[EKG changes in Hyperkalemia]] 
- [[RAAS markers]] 
### Management
- Start CPR if patient has no pulse
- Find severity
- Stabilize [[Myocardium]]
	- [[Calcium gluconate]] IV
- Remove potassium
	- Back into cells: [[Insulin]] + Dextrose
		- 10 units insulin given with 100 ml of 25% DEXTROSE given IV
	- [[Beta agonists]] Inhaled 
	- Magnesium Sulfate 
	- [[Diuretics]] like [[Loop diuretics]] 
- Treat underlying cause
- [[Sodium Bicarbonate]] if metabolic acidosis
- [[Dialysis]] in patients [[ESRD]]
- Urine output monitoring
- Potassium removal
	- Loop diuretics
	- Sodium polystyrene
	- Hemodialysis
