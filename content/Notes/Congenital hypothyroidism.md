### Etiology

| Cause                                          | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Thyroid gland abnormalities                    | Aplasia, hypoplasia, dysplasia, ectopy                                                                          |
| Transplacental maternal Antithyroid antibodies | Maternal antibodies affecting the fetal thyroid function                                                        |
| Defective Thyroid hormone synthesis            | Thyroid peroxidase deficiency leading to thyroid hyperplasia and goiter                                         |
| Peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones      | Resistance of peripheral tissues to the action of thyroid hormones                                              |
| Hypothalamic/pituitary abnormalities           | [[Septo-optic dysplasia]], [[Holoprosencephaly]], CNS insults, CNS tumors: [[Craniopharyngioma]], [[germinoma]] |
| Fetal Iodine deficiency syndrome               | Endemic in areas with [[iodine deficiency]], where features appear at birth                                     |


### Presentation
- No features apparent at birth due to maternal T4
- Features develop over weeks to  months
- Possible neonatal features
	- Abdominal distention: Pot-belly, delayed [[meconium]] passage 
	- Constipation: Delayed passage of [[meconium]]
	- [[Umbilical hernia]]
	- [[Prolonged neonatal jaundice]] 
		- most commonly due to [[Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia]] (Primarily due to decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and, to a lesser extent, due to increase enterohepatic circulation as a result of constipation) 
		- or less commonly [[Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia]] due to bile sludge formation and cholestasis
	- [[Infantile hypotonia (Floppy baby syndrome)]] : mixed type of features
	- Decreased activity, poor feeding, and adipsia
	- Wide posterior fontanelle
	- Hoarse cry, [[Macroglossia]], [[Hypothermia]], [[pallor]] 
	- [[Failure to thrive]], mainly height (delayed bone age) 
- [[Cretinism]] 

### Diagnostic
- Screening at 24-48 h is mandatory
- Increased TSH levels

### Management
- [[Thyroid replacement therapy]] immediately after diagnosis
- Levothyroxine 
	- In Neonates: 10-15 ug/kg/day
	- Children: 4 ug/kg/day
	- High dose may be needed on the basis of severity
	- Monthly monitoring in 1st 6 moths
	- 2-3 monthly 6-24 months
- Normalize levels within 2-3 weeks to prevent irreversible brain damage and developmental disorders
