### Contraindications
- CYP450 Induction: barbiturates enhance porphyrin synthesis, and therefore are absolutely contraindicated in patients with a history of [[ acute intermittent porphyria]]
- [[Anemia]]
- [[Myasthenia gravis]] 

### Barbiturate poisoning
| **Clinical Manifestations**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sedation/coma                | Dose-dependent sedation leading to decreased alertness, ataxia, coma, and suppression of brainstem reflexes. May mimic brain death.                            |
| Respiratory depression       | Potent central respiratory depression characterized by decreased tidal volume progressing to apnea with sufficient doses.                                      |
| Cardiovascular depression    | Can cause hypotension following overdose, likely due to insensible fluid losses, increased venous capacitance, and preload dependence.                         |
| Hypothermia                  | Common following barbiturate poisoning, characterized by thermoregulatory dysfunction and low body temperatures.                                               |
| Skin bullae                  | Tense, subepidermal, sterile bullae typically occurring 24 to 72 hours following intoxication, often called "coma blisters" or "barb blisters."                |
| Idiosyncratic drug reactions | Rarely cause drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).            |
| Intravenous diluent toxicity | High doses containing propylene glycol (eg, pentobarbital, phenobarbital) may lead to propylene glycol toxicity, manifesting as hypotension, bradycardia, etc. |
| Hypokalemia                  | Common with thiopental, potentially profound, and may lead to rebound hyperkalemia.                                                                            |
| Crystalluria                 | Reported with primidone overdose, causing crystalluria.                                                                                                        |
