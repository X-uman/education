### Pathophysiology
- Loss of one SHOX gene copy from the missing X chromosome

### Management
- The most common karyotypes observed are 45X Turner syndrome, 45X/46XX Turner mosaic, and 46,XY. 
- In this scenario, a 46,XY karyotype is associated with a high risk for the development of [[gonadoblastoma]] and [[dysgerminoma]], and surgical removal of the gonads may be necessary.
