### Pathophysiology in Injury 
- Within hours of upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endogenous Cytokines Antagonists enter the circulation:
	- Interleukin-1 Receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)
	- TNF-soluble receptors (TNF-sR-55 and 75)
- They act to control the proinflammatory response
- Further series of adaptive changes includes development of Th2-type counter inflammatory response which is regulated by:
	- IL-4, 5, 9, 13
	- TGF-beta
- Prolonged anti-inflammatory response can lead to [[Compensated anti-inflammatory response syndrome]] characterized by [[immunocompromised status]]
