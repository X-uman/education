### Types
 - Bare metal stent (BMS): bare-surfaced, metallic stent that provides a mechanical framework to keep the artery open.
	- After placement, endothelial cells begin to cover the bare surface of the stent (stent endothelialization) → ↓ exposure time of the foreign, thrombogenic material → ↓ risk of stent thrombosis → ↓ time of post-placement anticoagulation
	- Thus, bare metal stents are better suited to patients who are not compliant with long-term oral medications and/or those who may need to undergo surgery in the near future.
- Drug-eluting stent (DES): stents that are coated with antiproliferative substances (immunosuppressant drugs, cytostatic drugs) that prevent excessive intimal hyperplasia 
### Clinical implications
Discontinuation of P2Y12 receptor blockers (and sometimes aspirin) may be required before surgery. In patients with a cardiac stent, the risks of stent thrombosis must be balanced against the risk of bleeding or delaying surgery.
    - Balloon angioplasty (no stent): Delay elective surgery for two weeks.
    - Bare metal stent: Delay elective surgery for 30 days. 
	- Drug-eluting stent: Delay elective surgery for six months postplacement if possible.
