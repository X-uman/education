- A type of vitamin B12 deficiency caused by autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and/or gastric parietal cells (type II hypersensitivity reaction)
	- Anti-parietal cell antibodies: target gastric parietal cells
		- Causes ↓ acid production and atrophic gastritis
		- ↓ Intrinsic factor production → ↓ vitamin B12 absorption in terminal ileum
	- Anti-IF antibodies: bind intrinsic factor and block the vitamin B12 binding site
- Associated with other autoimmune diseases (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitiligo)
- Increases the risk of [[Gastric Carcinoma]] 

### Diagnostics
- Test for autoantibodies 
	- Anti-IF antibodies
	- Antiparietal cell antibodies
- If autoantibodies are negative, perform:
	- [[Schilling test]]
