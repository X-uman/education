### Indications
- Skin defect after burn, trauma, infection or following excision if primary closure cannot be prepared
- Cover and promote healing of [[Chronic wounds]]
- Adjunct to [[Flaps]] 
- A well-vascularized bed can accept a graft while a devascularized bed (eg, cartilage or bone) requires flap coverage
- A local flap will provide a better aesthetic result than a graft because it allows replacement of "like with like."
### Pathogenesis
1. Plasmatic imbibition
	- Fibrin adhesion, 
	- diffusion of nutrition  
	- fluid imbibition: weight increased by ~40%
2. Vascular inosculation: 
	- After 48 h 
	- capillary flow is established, skin becomes pink
3. Neovascularization: Vessels, Collagen linkage 

### Factors affecting
- Graft factors: thickness, vascularity, delay
- Wound bed factors: Infection, vascularity. 
- Systemic factors
- Environmental factors: Pressure, mobilization 

### Complications
- [[Graft failure]] 
- [[Hypertrophic scar]] and [[Keloid]] at both recipient and donor site
