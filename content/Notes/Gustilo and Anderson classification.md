| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Wound < 1 cm clean laceration                          |                                                                  |
| 2    | Wound 1-10 cm with minimal soft tissue damage          | [[wound care]]                                                   |
| 3    | Wound usually > 10 cm, with **high risk of infection** | [[wound care]]                                                   |
| 3a   | Adequate soft tissue coverage to cover the wound       | Wound edges can be approximated                                  |
| 3b   | Inadequate soft tissue coverage                        | [[flap]] needed to cover the wound, [[External Fixation]] needed |
| 3b   | Any open fracture with Ischemic vascular injury        | vascular surgery or [[Amputation]]                               |

- High risk of infection is seen in following conditions: they all come under Type 3 open fractures 
	- Extensive soft tissue damage
	- Farm injuries
	- Gunshot injuries
	- Delayed presentation > 6 h
	- high energy injury
	- Fracture may be crushed/avulsed 
	- Ischemic vascular damage
