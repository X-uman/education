### Definition
- OT position is a fetal cephalic malposition in which the sagittal suture and fontanels align 0 to <15 degrees from the transverse plane of the maternal pelvis
- If the occiput (posterior fontanelle) is on the mother's left side, the position is left OT (LOT); if the occiput (posterior fontanelle) is on the mother's right side, the position is right OT (ROT)
- LOT is more common than ROT.
### Prevalence
- Up to 50 percent of fetuses are OT at the onset of labor, but the prevalence falls to 19 to 20 percent in the second stage and 3 to 8 percent at the time of delivery
### Diagnostics
- Vaginal examination accepted standard for diagnosis of OT and is accurate because the sagittal suture is relatively easy to identify.
- One fetal ear can be palpated superiorly under the symphysis and the other inferiorly above the sacrum/coccyx.
- In settings where digital examination is equivocal, ultrasound assessment of fetal position can be helpful
- transperineal approaches tend to provide clearer images when the head is at a low station because shadowing from the maternal bony pelvis is eliminated
- In cases of OT with anterior or posterior [[asynclitism]] (rotation of the sagittal suture away from or toward the pubic symphysis), the lambdoid suture may be mistaken for the sagittal suture on physical examination and lead to an erroneous diagnosis of either occiput anterior (OA) or occiput posterior (OP). This generally happens late in labor when caput and molding are present.
- Determining the position of the ears can help avoid misdiagnosis

### Clinical course
- The widest dimension of the pelvic inlet is its transverse diameter, resulting in most fetuses being in the occiput transverse (OT) position as they pass through it. 
- While very small fetuses can maintain an OT position, larger OT fetuses often need to rotate anteriorly or posteriorly to facilitate vaginal delivery because the widest diameter of the pelvic outlet is its anteroposterior diameter.
- Fetuses that do not rotate and descend after at least two hours of active pushing can be divided into two subsets:
	- High transverse arrest – Arrest above station +2 (on a -5 cm to +5 cm scale)
	- Low (deep) transverse arrest – Arrest at or below station +2 (on a -5 cm to +5 cm scale)
- [[Transverse arrest]] 

### Management

##### No Transverse arrest
1. **Initial Stage:**
    - Assess for descent over time.
    - Monitor fetal heart rate pattern for reassurance.
    - Consider potential harm with intervention.
2. **If Descent and Fetal Heart Rate are Reassuring:**
    - Opt for expectant management.
    - Monitor closely for spontaneous rotation.
3. **If OT Position is Identified:**
    - Consider prophylactic rotation.
4. **During Expulsive Efforts:**
    - Monitor for spontaneous partial or complete rotation.
    - Ensure descent is continuing.
    - If hypocontractile uterine activity is present, contractions should be augmented with oxytocin. 
1. **If Progress Stops:**
    - Assess the need for manual rotation.
    - Consider risks associated with intervention.
2. **Considerations for Manual Rotation:**
    - Evaluate potential benefits of earlier versus later rotation.
    - Assess risks of umbilical cord prolapse or fetal/maternal injury.
3. **If Descent Continues and Rotation Does Not Occur:**
    - Continue expectant management.
    - Monitor closely for further descent or spontaneous rotation.
4. **Potential Challenges with Expectant Management:**
    - Longer second stage.
    - Possibility of more difficult rotation if head becomes impacted.
5. **Management of Protraction:**
    - If hypocontractile uterine activity is observed, consider oxytocin augmentation.

### Complications
- Persistence of the OT position in the second stage of labor usually results in labor protraction or arrest of descent, necessitating iatrogenic rotation or cesarean birth.
