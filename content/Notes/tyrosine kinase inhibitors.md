- Imatinib
- Erlotinib: [[Pancreatic carcinoma]] 

| TKI Generation    | Examples             | Indications                                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First-generation  | Imatinib             | Low-risk chronic phase (CP)-CML, patients with comorbidities, or older patients |
| Second-generation | Dasatinib, Nilotinib | Usually indicated in accelerated phase (AP)-CML                                 |
| Third-generation  | Ponatinib            | Especially effective in patients with additional mutations                      |

### Mechanism of action
- Selective inhibition of tyrosine kinase (e.g., by blocking its ATP binding site): inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins (no phosphate transfer from ATP to tyrosine residues)
- Disruption of the BCR-ABL1 pathway: inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL1-positive cells
### Special considerations
- Second-generation and third-generation TKIs are more effective in patients with certain additional mutations than first-generation TKIs, but are also associated with more adverse events.
- TKIs can interact with many common medications and herbal supplements (e.g., antacids, antidepressants, turmeric, green tea)
- Teratogenic, therefore, they should not be used during pregnancy.
