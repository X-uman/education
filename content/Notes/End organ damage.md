| Organ System | Hypertensive Emergency                                                   | Pathophysiology                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cardiac      | Heart failure exacerbation, de novo heart failure, flash pulmonary edema | - Elevated blood pressure leads to increased cardiac workload and fluid retention, exacerbating heart failure symptoms.                                       |
|              | [[Myocardial infarction]]                                                | - Hypertension can lead to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, causing acute myocardial infarction.                                                           |
|              | [[Aortic dissection]]                                                    | - High blood pressure can contribute to the dissection of the aorta, particularly in patients with underlying structural abnormalities or atherosclerosis.    |
| Neurological | [[Hypertensive encephalopathy]]                                          | - Severe hypertension disrupts cerebral blood flow autoregulation, leading to cerebral edema.                                                                 |
|              | Ischemic or hemorrhagic [[stroke]]                                       | - Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage or exacerbates ischemic stroke by disrupting perfusion to the brain.                 |
|              | [[PRES]] due to [[cerebral hyperperfusion]]                              | - Disruption of cerebral autoregulation and endothelial dysfunction lead to vasogenic edema, particularly in the posterior cerebral circulation.              |
| Renal        | [[AKI.canvas\|AKI]]                                                      | - Severe hypertension leads to acute [[microvascular thrombosis]] , resulting in renal microvascular damage and acute kidney injury, hemolysis and hemorrhage |
| Ophthalmic   | Acute [[hypertensive retinopathy]]                                       | - Elevated blood pressure causes damage to the retinal microvasculature, leading to retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and papilledema.                           |
| Other        | [[Hemolytic crisis]]                                                     | - Hypertension-induced damage to small blood vessels leads to mechanical hemolysis and fragmentation of red blood cells.                                      |

These hypertensive emergencies involve various organ systems and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and managed.
