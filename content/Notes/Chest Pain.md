1. Ischemia and Infarction usually present in a crescendo temporal pattern, get larger from a certain time, gets worse
2. Aortic, Pericarditis, Pleuritisâ€“maximum chest pain right at the onset, 10-10 on the instant pain occurs
3. Pain which goes to the back always involves an organ which at some point during embryogenesis passed through the retroperitoneum (duodenum, aorta, head of pancreas, kidney, etc.)
5. If pain is positional, it tends to involve architecture e.g. [[Pleuritis]], [[Pericarditis]]
6. If pain is continuous, it tends to involve an ongoing process e.g. MI
7. Pneumonia tends not to be severe and continuous
8. If chest pain is with a large pleural effusion, always consider neoplastic process
9. If severe chest pain is immediate in onset, and Patient has a history of hypertension, or the patient has a history of collagen-vascular disorders, like [[Ehler-Danlos Syndrome]] Consider [[Aortic dissection]]
