### Risk factors
- [[Clostridium difficile]] is the cause of pseudomembranous colitis, where destruction of the normal colonic bacterial flora
- Any antibiotic may cause this phenomenon, although the quinolones such as ciprofloxacin seem to be the highest risk, especially in elderly or immunocompromised patients.

### Presentation
- colitis may lead to perforation and the need for emergency colectomy with an associated high mortality
- The fibrinous exudate is typical and differentiates the colitis from other inflammatory diseases; laboratory recognition of the toxin is an early accurate diagnostic test.

### Management
- [[Isolation ward protocols]] 
- [[Fidaxomicin]] 
- Fulminant: High dose oral [[vancomycin]], enema if [[Paralytic ileus]], because Vancomycin is considered gold standard in treatment and Fidaxomicin has limited data available #research 
- Consider IV [[Metronidazole]] which may be helpful in patients with [[Paralytic ileus]] but has not been shown to reduce mortality and recurrence rates.
