### Criteria for positive findings
##### more than
- 10 ml blood
- 1 Lakh RBC/microliter
- 500 WBC WBC
- 175 IU/l Amylase 
##### or presence of
- Bile 
- Alkaline phosphatase
- Food particles
- Vegetable matter

### Indications
- Multiple injuries
- #obsolete and replaced by [[FAST scan]] and [[eFAST]] scans
- DPL should only be considered in hemodynamically unstable patients who have an inconclusive FAST scan. 
- Although highly sensitive, DPL has largely fallen out of favor because it is an invasive procedure; it may, however, be necessary in some cases (e.g., in resource-poor settings).
### Disadvantages
- Invasive
- Non-repetitive
- False positive results which leads to non-therapeutic laparotomy
- [[Retroperitoneal injuries]]
