### Introduction
Low voltage current: Small, painful, deeper burns, tetany develops, no myocardial damage but can cardiac arrest, recovery
High voltage: 
	Flash burns due to arc
	Flame induced burns
	Entry and exit points necrosis 
		Myonecrosis and compartment syndrome
		Myoglobinuria and Acute tubular necrosis
		Myocardial damage: Cardiac enzymes raised and ECG changes
	#managment [[Urine output]] >2ml/kg/hr needed

### Types
- High voltage
- low voltage (< 1000 V)
	- Small, localized deep burn +/- underlying tendon and nerve damage
	- [[Tetany]]: unable to release devices
	- Cardiac arrest
- High voltage
	- Burn due to flash and flame from heating of surrounding air
	- Burn at entry and exit points
	- Damage of the muscles: [[Compartment syndrome]] 
	- Direct myocardial damage
	- Severe [[Acidosis]] which may require bicarbonate supplementation 

### Pathology
- Epidermis: Elongation of cells with streaming of nuclei (palisading appearance)
- Vacuolation
- Zenker's degeneration Of skeletal muscles.
	- Coagulative necrosis: Hyaline appearance, Grossly the muscles appear pale and friable; microscopically, the muscle fibres are swollen, have a loss of cross striations, and show a hyaline appearance. Cauterization of the muscles???
	- Also seen in typhoid, toxemia
- Melting of the calcium phosphate in bone.
	- Round dense foci in X-ray limb.
	- Bone pearls / wax drippings
### Presentation
#### Local effects 
- Joule burns
	- Endogenous burn
	- A specific & diagnostic of electric burns.
	- Found at the point of entry.
	- Firm contact with Low voltage current.
	- Round/ oval, shallow craters, 1-1.5 cm diameter, raised border Of
	- 1-3 mm high, crater floor is lined by pale flattened skin.
	- Commonly found over exposed parts (palmer aspects Of hand).
- Spark /flash burns
	- Loose contact with air gap.
	- Melting & re-solidification Of keratin : hard, brownish nodules.
	- Crocodile burns
		- Loose contact with high voltage current.
		- Multiple punched out spark lesions over the exposed part Of the body due to arcing of high tension current.
- Electric burns or splits: Develops into aseptic necrosis
- Arc Eye: 
	- Photokeratitis due to heat and UV rays from electric arc 
	- stab or Bullet like effect on the body
- Current pearls
	- Deposition of the molted metal from the conductor to the tissue(metallization).
	- Identified by scanning electron microscopy
### Cause of death
- Electricity passing through head: [[Medullary paralysis]]
- Heart: [[Ventricular fibrillation]] 

### Post-mortem findings
- Heart: Bark like appearance in the myocardial fibers, contraction bands, often seen in sub-epicardial myocardium after resuscitation that includes electrical defibrillation
- Skeletal muscles: Zenker's degeneration, which is Rhabdomyolysis
- Current pearls
	- Bones: Melting calcium phosphate: bone pearls or wax drippings, zigzag fractures, bone necrosis
- Judicial Electrocution: vacuolation around vessels
- Lightening: Filigree burns or Arborescent burns (Reddish, erythema that appears within 1 hrs of accident and fades within 24 hrs, not burns), does not follow vascular channels
- fusion of metal objects
