### Definition
| Term                           | Definition                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** | - Formation of one or more blood clots in a deep vein, typically of the lower extremities                 |
|                                | - Proximal DVT: DVT affecting the femoral vein, profunda femoris vein, and/or the popliteal vein          |
|                                | - Distal DVT: DVT confined to the veins beyond the calf vein trifurcation (below the knee joint)          |
| **Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)** | - Umbrella term encompassing DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE)                                           |
| **Recurrent VTE**              | - VTE that recurs in a patient after completing the first 2 weeks of antithrombotic therapy                |
| **Provoked VTE**               | - VTE occurring in an individual with â‰¥ 1 risk factor for VTE                                            |
| **Unprovoked VTE (Idiopathic VTE)** | - VTE occurring in an individual without risk factors for VTE                                           |

### Etiology
- [[Virchow's Triad]] 

### Presentation
- More common in the left lower extremity Due to compression of the left iliac vein by the overlying right iliac artery 
- Swelling, feeling of tightness or heaviness
- Pain is worse while walking and improves with elevation of the leg. 
- Warmth, erythema, and possibly livid discoloration 
- Signs (Not encouraged to prevent dislodgement)
	- Homan's sign: Pain on passive dorsiflexion
	- Mose's sign: Pain on squeezing calf
	- Payr sign: pain when pressure is applied over the medial part of the sole of the foot
- Distention of superficial veins
- Distal pulses are normal

### Diagnostics
- [[Wells criteria for DVT and PE]]  are used to determine the pretest probability of DVT
	- Low probability: Negative [[D-dimer]] helps to rule out the disease
	- Moderate/High probability: [[Duplex USG]] 
- Ascending venography if thrombolysis is being considered #obsolete  
- MR venography
- CT Angiography of lung: may show filling defect in lung
- [[thrombophilia panel]]

### Complications
- [[Post-thrombotic syndrome]]
- [[Pulmonary Embolism]] from lower extremity DVT
- Extension of a proximal Upper Extremity DVT can cause [[SVC syndrome]] . The risk is highest with secondary UEDVT. 
### Differential diagnosis
- [[Baker cyst]] rupture
- Calf [[Muscle hematoma]]
- Rupture Plantaris muscle
- Popliteal aneurysm
- Arterial ischemia 
- [[Compartment syndrome]]
- [[Lymphedema]]
- [[superficial thrombophlebitis]]
- [[Cellulitis]]
