### Epithelial tumors

| Type      | Tumor                        | Special features                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Benign    | [[Pleomorphic adenoma]]      | Commonest benign tumor of salivary glands |
|           | [[Warthin's tumor]]          |                                           |
|           | [[Oncocytoma]]               |                                           |
| Malignant | [[Mucoepidermoid tumor]]     | Commonest malignant tumor of parotid      |
|           | [[Adenoid cystic carcinoma]] | Commonest Submandibular gland tumor       |
|           | [[Acinic cell carcinoma]]    | Best prognosis amongst malignant tumors   |
|           | Squamous cell carcinoma      |                                           |
|           | Pleomorphic adenocarcinoma   |                                           |
|           | Adenocarcinoma               |                                           |
- Submandibular gland tumors are less common but more frequently malignant than parotid tumors. Generally, the smaller the gland, the higher the risk a tumor is malignant!

#### Classification on basis of location of epithelium

| Structure                               | Tumor                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Acinus**                              | Acinic cell carcinoma         |
| **Myoepithelial cells**                 | Myoepithelial tumors          |
| **Intercalated duct**                   | Pleomorphic adenoma           |
|                                         | Adenoid cystic carcinoma      |
|                                         | Polymorphous Adenocarcinoma   |
| **Striated duct**                       | Warthin tumor                 |
|                                         | Oncocytoma                    |
| **Interlobular and intralobular ducts** | Mucoepidermoid carcinoma      |
|                                         | Papillary carcinoma           |
|                                         | Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) |
|                                         | Salivary duct carcinoma       |

- All salivary glands are common in females except Warthin's tumor
- Rarely, Lymphoepithelioma or [[Godwin's tumor]] may arise from [[Parotid Gland]]
- Benign lymphoepithelial cyst: HIV patients
- For Minor salivary Gland MCS is [[Hard palate]] and usually adenocarcinomas

### investigations 
- [[FNAC]] for confirmation of tumor
- Deep lobe tumors and Bone: [[CT-scan]]
- For staging: [[MRI]]
- [[Techenetium-99 scan]] shows Hot spot in Warthin's tumor


### Features suggestive of malignancy
- [[Facial nerve palsies]]
- [[Lymph nodes]] enlargement
- Sudden enlargement of glands
- Pain
- Skin Ulceration
- [[Satellite lesions]]
- Restricted movement
