| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Idiopathic**  | Familial or sporadic cases with unknown cause      |
| **Hereditary**  | [[Segawa syndrome]]                                |
| **Drugs**       | [[Dopamine antagonists]]                           |
| **Neurologic**  | [[Huntington's Chorea]] , [[Parkinsonism]] |
| **Metabolic**   | Wilson disease, Hypoxia                            |

| **Toxic**       | [[Cobalt]]                                         |

### Drug induced acute dystonia
- Earliest side effect of drug, indicated effect 
- seen more in young males
- Examples
	- Trismus
	- Torticollis
	- Oculogyric crisis
	- Laryngeal dystonia
- Parenteral anticholinergic drugs
- Dystonia is classified according to the anatomic distribution of the symptoms into focal, multifocal, segmental, and generalized dystonia. 
- Treatment involves pharmacologic management with levodopa or anticholinergic agents, as well as treatment of the underlying cause if possible.
- Focal dystonias respond well to periodic botulinum toxin injections in the affected muscle.

### Classification

| Type        | Conditions                                                                                                      | Causes                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focal       | Spasmodic torticollis; Blepharospasm; Spasmodic dysphonia; Oromandibular dystonia; Writer's dystonia            | Majority are idiopathic                                              |
| Segmental   | Affects ≥ 2 adjacent regions of the body<br>Meige syndrome: blepharospasm with oromandibular dystonia           |                                                                      |
| Generalized | Affects the trunk and at least two additional regions of the body <br>Typically early onset (< 21 years of age) | Antipsychotics, Parkinsonism, Segawa syndrome, [[Torsion dystonia]]  |
### Treatment
- Levodopa/carbidopa: A trial should be taken in all patients with childhood-onset dystonia to distinguish dopa-responsive dystonia from the other forms. 
- Anticholinergics (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl) or antihistamines (diphenhydramine)
- Periodic botulinum toxin injections: for focal dystonia 
- [[Deep brain stimulation]] 
- Treatment of underlying disorder of acquired dystonia (e.g., cessation of the causative drug)
- Supportive measures: physiotherapy, ergotherapy
