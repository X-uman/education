| Feature                    | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Location                   | Diaphysis, metaphysis, epiphysis; cortex, medulla, endosteal, paraosteal (centric vs eccentric)                                     |
| Shape, size                | Varies depending on lesion type and stage of development                                                                            |
| Border                     | Sharp/sclerotic, diffuse, lobulated; sclerotic rim (thick or thin), wide/narrow zone of transition                                  |
| Density                    | Hypodense/hyperdense: [[Lytic bone lesions]], [[bone metastases]]                                                                   |
| Consistency                | Homogeneous, heterogeneous;<br>[[Soap bubble lesions]],<br>ground glass appearance,<br>popcorn/arc and ring,<br>cumulous or blastic |
| Locules                    | Multiloculated/uniloculated                                                                                                         |
| Local effect of the lesion | Surrounding bone:<br>destruction/expansion,<br>periosteum lifted or not,<br>[[periosteal reaction]] <br>soft tissue involvement     |
