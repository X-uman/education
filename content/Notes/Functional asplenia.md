### causes
- [[Sickle Cell disease]]: Most patients have lost splenic function by the age of 2–4 years.

### Pathogenesis
- [[Splenic infarction]] → decreased IgM levels and decreased opsonin production → decreased phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria → increased susceptibility to infections by encapsulated bacteria 
- Increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae (most common), Neisseria meningitis, Hemophilic influenzae type b, Salmonella typhi)
- Appearance of Howell-Jolly bodies in RBCs

### Complications
- See complications of [[Splenectomy]] 
- Pneumonia
- Meningitis
- [[Osteomyelitis]] (most common cause: Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus)
- Sepsis (most common cause: Streptococcus pneumoniae)
