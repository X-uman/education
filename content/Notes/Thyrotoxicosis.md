### Presentation
- CNS:

	- Fine tremors
	- Tongue fasciculations
- CVS
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Atrial extrasystole
	- Atrial fibrillation
	- Congestive cardiac failure
	- Thyroid storm
	- Lerman scratch sound on expiration in 2nd left ICS
- Eye sigs
	- [[Thyroid Eye disease]]
- Primary toxicosis is common in young age, secondary is common older ages
	- In primary, CNS and Eye signs are more common.
	- In secondary, CVS signs are common because older people already have weak heart
