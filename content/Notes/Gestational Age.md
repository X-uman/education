### Calculation from LMP

### Uterine Size and Gestational Age Correlation
- **6 to 8 weeks:** Plum-sized uterus (pelvic organ)
- **8 to 10 weeks:** Orange-sized uterus (pelvic organ)
- **10 to 12 weeks:** Grapefruit-sized uterus (pelvic organ)
- **12 weeks:** Uterus begins to be palpable abdominally above the symphysis pubis
- **16 weeks:** Fundus palpable midway between symphysis pubis and umbilicus
- **20 weeks:** Fundus palpable at the umbilicus
- **After 20 weeks:** Symphysis-to-fundal height in centimeters correlates with the week of gestation

### Calculation from USG 
- [[Crown rump length]]
- [[Gestational sac]]
- The four standard biometric parameters used to estimate gestational age if the initial ultrasound examination is in the second trimester (14+0 to 27+6 weeks) or third trimester (28+0 weeks to delivery) are BPD, HC, abdominal circumference (AC), and FL. 
	- [[Biparietal diameter]]
	- [[Head circumference]]
	- [[Abdominal circumference]]
	- [[Femoral length]]
- These measurements should never be used to change an EDD determined in the first trimester by CRL, since the latter is more accurate. Instead, they are used to determine whether fetal size is within the normal range or restricted, accelerated, or asymmetric based on the previously calculated EDD.
