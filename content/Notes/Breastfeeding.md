- [[Lactation]] 
### notes
- Start within 1 h of birth 
- The [[vitamin D]] content of breast milk is not considered to be high enough to prevent complications from developing in infants, unless the mother is given adequate supplementation
- Therefore, the FDA currently recommends that all exclusively breastfed infants receive 400 international units of daily vitamin D supplementation until 1 year of age (when fortified cow milk is typically introduced). This supplementation protects against hypocalcemia and rickets

### Breastmilk evolution
![[Pasted image 20240512223538.png]]
### Questions
- Colostrum given?
- Time of first feed
- Prelacteal feeds given?
- Feeds/night and frequency of breastfeeding should be at least 8/24 h
- Additional food
- Formula milk/day and dilution
- Utensil for feeding-how is it cleaned
- Barriers for breastfeeding if any
- [[decreased urine output]]
- [[Breast]] 
- [[Complementary feeding]] 

### Observation
- [[Breastfeeding technique]] 
- [[Breast examination]] 
- Among breastfed children in developing countries, average breastmilk energy intake is 413, 379, and 346 kcal/d at 6—8, 9—11 and 12— 23 months, respectively (WHO/ UNICEF, 1998). 
- The equivalent values for industrialized countries (for breastfed children only) are 486, 375, and 313 kcal/d, respectively
### Contraindications
- Baby: [[Galactosemia]] 
- Mother: 
	- Permanent vs temporary contraindications
	- Permanent: HIV, HTLV, Cocaine, Phencyclidine, Ebola
	- Temporary: [[brucellosis]], Drugs, HSV
- Cannot breastfeed but may be given milk
	- Untreated Active TB
	- Mother has active varicella that developed between 5 days prior to delivery and 2 days following delivery
