#Risk_Factors 
	Tobacco
	Alcohol
	Betel nut chewing
	Vitamin A, C, E deficiency
	UV radiation (Lip cancers)
	Infections in (immunocompromised patients)
		[[HPV]] 16, 18
		[[Syphilis]]
		[[HIV]]
	Genetics
		[[p53]] mutation
		[[Plummer vinson syndrome]]
		[[Fanconi Anemia]]

#Pathophysiology 
	Field cancerization:
		Synchronous cancers: Cancer happening in other parts of oral cavity within 6 months
		Metachronous cancers: After 6 months
		15% chances of developing second cancer somewhere else in oral cavity
	Commonest #microscopy  [[Squamous cell carcinoma]]
	Spreads by Lymph node [[Metastasis]]
	Tongue cancer can spread directly to Level III LNs: Skip [[Metastasis]] 

#staging #link AJCC 8th Edition of Oral cancer staging

#Presentation 
	Any ulcer/mass in oral cavity not healing for >3 weeks or Lymph node swelling for > 3 weeks: Warrants further evaluation
	may be #associated with odynophagia, Pain, Sore tongue, trismus, bleeding

#investigations 
	#ioc for diagnosis by Wedge [[Tissue diagnosis]]  from edge of mass along with normal tissue for comparison (larger part of the mass and small normal part)
	For [[Premalignant lesions]], 2% Toluidine blue can be used as contrast to visualize cancerous area
	For Enlarged Lymph node: Excision or FNAC under USG Guidance
	For TN #staging [[MRI]] (Short Tau Inversion Recovery MRI or STIR MRI) with Gadolinium contrast
	For Metastasis: [[CT-scan]] of Lungs can be done, or [[PET-CT Scan]] if [[Radiotherapy]] without surgery planned 

#managment 
	#surgery Resection with 1cm margin is the #RxoC 
	Radiotherapy also indicated
