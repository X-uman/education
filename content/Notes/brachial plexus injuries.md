- Excessive lateral traction on the neck during delivery → injury to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus → [[Erb palsy]] (most common iatrogenic brachial plexus injury during delivery)
- Excessive traction on the arm during delivery → injury to the lower trunk of the brachial plexus → [[Klumpke palsy]]
- Prognosis: approx. 25% of affected infants experience persistent functional impairment [8]

- Brachial plexus injury is associated with [[shoulder dystocia]], which more commonly leads to Erb palsy than Klumpke palsy.
