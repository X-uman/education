### Procedure
- until healthy, viable (bleeding) tissue is reached
- Inspection and debridement in the operating room should be continued every one to two days until necrotic tissue is no longer present
### Considerations
- Maintaining vascular integrity is crucial; prolonged application of tourniquets should be avoided, and traumatic wounds such as compound fractures should not be surgically closed prematurely
