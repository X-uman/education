- Rachitic pelvis/Triradiate pelvis 
	- Commonest cause of true CPD in developing countries 
	- The most pronounced changes affecting any single portion of the pelvis are manifested in the sacrum, and it is the recognition of sacral deformity that offers the greatest aid in establishing the diagnosis of rachitic pelvis. 
- Osteomalacic pelvis
	- Downward displacement of sacrum
	- Lateral pubic walls are pushed inwards giving a beaked appearance  
	- Markedly shortened sacrum
	- Coccyx is pulled forwards
