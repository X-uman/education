- Secondary intention
- Delayed primary closure
### Stages
| Timeline        | Healing Phase     | Key Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Immediately     | Hemostasis        | - Small vessels within the wound constrict immediately after injury, providing initial hemostasis<br>- Platelets aggregate in severed vessels, triggering the clotting cascade<br>- Fibrin matrix stabilizes the wound and provides a scaffold for healing                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3 days-1st week | Inflammation      | - Completed within three days, except in cases of infection or wound chronicity<br>- Increased vascular permeability and cellular recruitment<br>- Mononuclear leukocytes transform into macrophages<br>- Mast cells degranulate, releasing mediators of vasodilation and cellular migration<br>- Chemotaxis results in migration and concentration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes                                                                     |
|                 | Epithelialization | - Basal cell proliferation and epithelial migration within fibrin bridgework of the clot<br>- Proliferation continues until cells are surrounded by similar types<br>- In surgical wounds, epithelial cells migrate downward to meet deep in the dermis<br>- Migration ceases when the layer is rejuvenated, typically within 48 hours                                                                                                                  |
| 1st-6th wks     | Fibroplasia       | - Fibroblast proliferation, accumulation of ground substance, and collagen production<br>- Fibroblasts attach to the fibrin matrix, produce glycoprotein and mucopolysaccharides<br>- Myofibroblasts develop contractile properties, helping to pull wound edges together<br>- Collagen production begins within 24 hours, with maximum production at day five<br>- Developing collagen matrix stimulates angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation |
| 6th wks- 2nd yr | Maturation        | - Collagen cross-linking and remodeling, wound contraction, and repigmentation<br>- Tropocollagen forms triple helix, which combines to form collagen<br>- **Collagen types I and III predominate in skin and aponeurotic layers**<br>- Tensile strength directly proportional to collagen amount<br>- Covalent cross-links enhance tensile strength<br>- Full tissue strength attained by six weeks, with continued remodeling over many years         |

### Factors preventing wound healing
- Local Factors: Wound perfusion, infections, foreign bodies, necrotic tissue, 
- Systemic factors
	- [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] 
	- Low albumin levels: [[Malnutrition]] 
- Surgery
	- Emergency wound > Elective
	- Midline incision > Transverse
	- Absorbable [[Sutures]] > Non-absorbable
