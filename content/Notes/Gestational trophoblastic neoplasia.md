### Definition
- Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) refers to a group of malignant neoplasms that consist of abnormal proliferation of trophoblastic tissue, and may follow a hydatidiform mole or a nonmolar pregnancy
### Etiology

| Causes | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 50%    | - arise from [[Hydatidiform mole]] <br>- Approximately 15 percent of [[Complete mole]] will develop local invasion<br>- 5 percent will develop metastatic disease <br>- GTN, usually non-metastatic, occurs in 1 to 4 percent of patients after partial mole |
| 25%    | from [[Pregnancy loss]] or [[Ectopic Pregnancy]]                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 25%    | from term or preterm pregnancy                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Histological types
- [[Invasive mole]]
- [[Choriocarcinoma]]
- [[placental site trophoblastic tumors]]
- [[Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor]] 

### Presentation
- History of evacuation of [[Complete mole]] with following characteristics
	- pre-evacuation uterine size is larger than gestational age
	- human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level >100,000 milli-international units/mL
- Bilateral [[Theca-lutein cysts]]

### Diagnostics
###### [[β-hCG]]
- High in invasive mole and choriocarcinoma while PSTT and ETT typically have low hCG levels
- **IM/choriocarcinoma:** can typically range from 100 to over 100,000 milli-international units/mL depending on the extent of disease
- **PSTT/ETT:** hCG levels in these patients are usually <1000 milli-international units/mL but are infrequently undetectable

| Situation                | Diagnosis Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| After Molar Pregnancy    | - Weekly hCG levels plateau (remain within ±10 percent of the previous result) over a three-week period <br>- hCG level increases >10 percent across three values recorded over a two-week duration <br>- Persistence of detectable serum hCG for more than six months after molar evacuation no longer considered diagnostic for GTN. <br>- Spontaneous hCG remission observed in most cases with persistent but falling hCG levels six months after molar evacuation. <br>- Diagnosis also accepted based on histologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma or invasive mole and/or clinical or radiological evidence of metastases. |
| After Nonmolar Pregnancy | - Elevated hCG, with exclusion of other explanations than GTN, is sufficient for diagnosis. <br>- Findings on examination or imaging suggesting metastatic disease support the diagnosis. <br>- Biopsies not recommended due to risk of hemorrhage; histologic confirmation not necessary for diagnosis. <br>- Exception: postpartum or postabortal bleeding, uterine enlargement, or evidence of uterine disease on imaging may warrant uterine curettage for confirmation of diagnosis. <br>- Most common histologic type presumed to be choriocarcinoma, unless proven otherwise.                                            |

###### Other tests
- Elevated hCG: evaluate using USG
- [[Thyroid function tests]] should be ordered if the hCG level is >100,000 milli-international units/mL to determine if the patient may be hyperthyroid. Patient may have risk of [[Thyroid storm]] 
- These lesions should **not** be biopsied because they are extremely vascular and hemorrhage may occur
#### Metastasis
- [[Lung metastases]]: Cannon-ball appearance 
- Vagina
- CNS: [[Intrathecal route]] may be needed
- Hepatic
- Other: kidney, spleen, GIT

##### Workup
- LFT/RFT for metastasis
- CXR for lung metastasis
- Testosterone for virilization

| 0-6   | Low risk                               | - Consider [[Single-agent chemotherapy for GTN.pdf]] such as [[Methotrexate in Hydatidiform mole]] <br> - Monitor for disease remission with three consecutive weekly normal hCG values (<5 mIU/mL). | [[Etoposide]], [[5-Flurouracil]], [[Carboplatin]]                     |
| >=7   | High risk of resistance to monotherapy | - [[EMA-CO Regimen]] <br> - Manage brain metastasis with [[EMA-CO Regimen]] with high-dose MTX + cranial radiation therapy (RT).                                                                     | - Intrathecal MTX may be an option for patients declining cranial RT. |
| >=12  | Ultra-high risk                        | - Associated with nonmolar antecedent pregnancy, brain metastases, and failed prior multiagent chemotherapy. <br> - Requires aggressive management and possibly novel treatment approaches.          |                                                                       |
- Obstetric emergency 
 - performing a second D&C may be indicated for management of persistent uterine bleeding
