### Complications
- Headaches or visual disturbances such as [[scotoma]] can be premonitory symptoms of eclampsia. 
	- Severe headache (ie, incapacitating, "the worst headache I've ever had") or headache that persists and progresses despite analgesic therapy with acetaminophen and not accounted for by alternative diagnoses
- [[Cortical blindness]]: rare and typical transient 
- [[Retinal vasculopathy]]: may be permanent  
	- Blurred vision
	- Photopsia
	- Scotoma
	- [[Amaurosis Fugax]] 
	- Diplopia 
- Retinal vasospasm 
- [[Notes/Headache]] and visual symptoms are common with severe preeclampsia, and associated convulsions define eclampsia.

##### Seen in severe elevations 
- [[Hemorrhagic Stroke]] 
	- Eclamptic seizures occur in some, but not all, cases
- Features of [[PRES]]—PRES, most frequently affected region is the parietooccipital cortex
	- - [[Generalized tonic-clonic seizure]] seizures or [[Eclampsia]]
- Generalized hyperreflexia 

### Management
- Acetaminophen is commonly used to treat headache. Doses ≤2 g/day can be administered safely to many patients with preeclampsia-related hepatic or renal insufficiency.
