### Note
There are several diagnostic criteria for AS (e.g., New York criteria, Rome criteria). The Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis, which is based on a combination of clinical features and imaging or laboratory findings, is detailed here.

- Lower back pain for > 3 months in patients < 45 years of age and one of the following:
    - [[Sacroiliitis]] confirmed on x-ray or MRI and ≥ 1 typical **clinical or laboratory finding** OR
	- A positive HLA-B27 test and ≥ 2 typical clinical or laboratory findings

- Lower back pain > 3 months in < 45 y patient + (confirmed Sacroiliitis + 1 clinical/lab)/(HLA-B27 + 2 clinical/lab)
- Clinical: articular, extraarticular, family history symptoms relieved on NSAIDS
- Lab: HLA B27, CRP, ESR
