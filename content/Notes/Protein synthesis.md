- Functional Proteins i.e. enzymes metabolic rate inside the cells increased, they increase O2 utilization, Oxidative Phosphorylation
- Structural Proteins--leads to cells growth---Mental and Physical Growth of the body, hence deficiency leads to decreased mental and physical growth in the body
	- [[Collagen synthesis]]
	-
