### Effects

### Effects during pregnancy
- Optimizes transport of zygote along the fallopian tube
- Elevated progesterone concentrations after ovulation trigger an increase in basal body temperature 
- Facilitates successful implantation of an embryo (â†‘ receptiveness of endometrium)
- Maintains pregnancy
- Transformation of endometrium (stimulation of secretory function and spiral artery development)
- Prevents menstruation
- Closure of the cervix and increased viscosity of cervical secretion, preventing sperm entry
- Inhibits uterine contractions
- Stimulates the expression of uterine oxytocin receptors prior to delivery
- Inhibits further differentiation of breast tissue in the second half of pregnancy
- Following delivery, rapid decline of progesterone triggers secretory activation of lactogenesis phase, marked by copious milk production
- Improves endometrial receptiveness towards implantation, prevents menstruation, closure of cervix and increased viscosity of cervical mucus, inhibits uterine contractions, stimulates expression of oxytocin receptors
### Course
- Increases continuously until birth
- Rapid fall after delivery
