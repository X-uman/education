- [[Notes/Hyperammonemia]] associated with [[Aspirin]] use for viral [[fever]] in children <19 (common 4 y)
- disease presents 3-5 days after viral illness
- Viruses alter the metabolism of [[salicylates]] → accumulation of salicylate metabolites in the [[Hepatic insufficiency]] → [[mitochondria]] injury and reversible inhibition of enzymes required for [[fatty acid oxidation]] → failure of hepatic [[ATP]] production → [[acute hepatic failure]] → Failure of [[Urea cycle]] and [[Notes/Hyperammonemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and [[hepatic steatosis]] → acute encephalopathy 
- [[Oxidative phosphorylation uncouplers]]
- [[microvesicular steatosis]] 
### Clinical features
- Features of increased [[Intracranial pressure]]
- Features of [[Liver dysfunction]] and [[hepatitis]] ([[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]])
- Features of [[Notes/Hyperammonemia]]
- Features of [[Hypoglycemia]] 

### Investigations
- [[Liver function tests]]
- [[Cerebral edema]] in [[Neuroimaging]]
- [[Lumbar puncture]] and [[CSF Analysis]]: R/O [[Intracranial infections]] 
- Liver biopsy: microvesicular steatosis

### Treatment
- Management of [[Intracranial pressure]],[[Notes/Hyperammonemia]] 
- Correct [[hypoglycemia]]
- Cardiopulmonary support

### Prevention
- Avoid [[Aspirin]] <19 y with [[fever]]
- Exception [[Kawasaki disease]]
