### Instrumentation

| **Type of Forceps** | **Description**                                                                              | Examples        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Outlet Forceps**  | Designed for use when the fetal head is at or on the perineum.                               | Wrigley Forceps |
| **Low Forceps**     | Used when the fetal head is at +2 station or lower but not on the perineum.                  |                 |
| **Midforceps**      | Applied when the fetal head is engaged but above +2 station, not commonly used               |                 |
| **High Forceps**    | Historically used when the fetal head was unengaged; no longer recommended due to high risk. |                 |

| Forceps                    | Features                                                                                           | Advantage                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kielland Forceps**       | Have a sliding mechanism and minimal pelvic curve, allowing rotation of the fetal head.            | Ideal for rotational deliveries, such as when the fetal head is in the occiput transverse position. |
| **Wrigley Forceps**        | Short and light, used for low forceps deliveries and when minimal traction is needed.              | Suitable for outlet deliveries and often used in cesarean sections to aid delivery of the head.     |
| **Simpson Forceps**        | Have a cephalic curve and fenestrated blades, designed to accommodate the shape of the fetal head. | Versatile, can be used for both low and midforceps deliveries.                                      |
| **Tucker-McLane Forceps**  | Similar to Simpson forceps but with a less pronounced cephalic curve.                              | Often used for low and outlet forceps deliveries.                                                   |
| **Piper Forceps**          | Specifically designed for the aftercoming head in breech deliveries.                               | Used to deliver the head when the body has already been delivered in a breech presentation.         |
| **Neville-Barnes Forceps** | Feature a prominent cephalic curve and are used for lower forceps deliveries.                      | Often employed in cases of occiput anterior or occiput posterior positions.                         |
