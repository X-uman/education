- GnRH receptor antagonists (e.g., ganirelix) bind to the pituitary GnRH receptors and decrease the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). 
- The decrease in LH and FSH subsequently leads to decreased production of androgens and estrogen. 
- If administered in the late follicular phase, it can prevent premature ovulation.
