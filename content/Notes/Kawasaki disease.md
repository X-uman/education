### Introduction
- Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome
- M > F, Asian, <5 y, Sibling 
- Cardiac complication
- Commonest vasculitis in chilldren
### Acute phase
- Lasts 1-2 weeks
- High grade fever without apparent cause for 5 days or more
- Mucocutaneous redness
	- Skin rashes (particularly accentuated in chest and inguinal area)
	- Conjunctival redness bilaterally
	- Lips: Dry, cracked
	- Tongue: Red (aka Strawberry tongue)
- [[Cervical lymphadenopathy]] (> 1.5 cm)
- Other features
	- Hand and feet swelling
	- [[myocarditis]]
	- Giant [[Coronary aneurysms]] 
##### Subacute phase
- After 2-4 weeks 
- Peeling of skin: of the fingers and toes
- Cartilage: [[Osteoarthritis]]
- [[Coronary aneurysms]] pose risk of sudden death, appear commonly in subacute and convalescent phase,  risk factors are: 
	- Age < 1 y or > 9 y
	- Male gender
	- Fever >= 14 days
	- [[Hyponatremia]] 
	- Hematocrit < 35%
	- WBC > 12,000 

### Convalescent phase
- Lasts 6-8 weeks
- Clinical symptoms disappear and continues till ESR returns to normal
- [[Beau lines]] on nail may appear during this phase

### Diagnostic criteria
- Fever >= 5 days + At least 4 out of following 5: 
	1. BL non-purulent [[conjunctivitis]]
	2. Oral and oropharyngeal mucosal injection
		- Dry fissured lips or injected lips
		- Strawberry tongue
		- Pharyngeal injection 
	3. Peripheral extremities involvement 
		- Early: Edema, Erythema
		- Later: Desquamation which begins around nail 
	4. Non-vesicular polymorphous rash, primarily in trunks 
	5. Cervical LAN at least 1 node >= 1.5 cm, usually Unilateral
- Illness not explained by any other known diseases

### Diagnostics
- [[IV Immunoglobulins]] 
- Aspirin at anti-inflammatory doses
	- 80-100 mg/kg/day in acute phase
	- After fever resolves, anti-thrombotic dose of 3-5 mg/kg/day as single dose
	- Continued through subacute and chronic phase until follow-up echocardiography fails to demonstrate coronary aneurysms

### Complications
- [[Coronary Artery]]
	- [[Coronary aneurysms]] 
	- [[Coronary artery thrombosis]]
	- [[Myocardial infarction]]
	- [[Myocarditis]]
	- [[Pericarditis]]
	- [[Congestive Cardiac failure]]
- [[Hydrops of gall bladder]]
- [[Aseptic meningitis]]
- Sterile pyuria
- [[Thrombocytosis]] in later stage
- [[Diarrhea]]
- [[Pancreatitis]] 
- [[Gangrene]]
