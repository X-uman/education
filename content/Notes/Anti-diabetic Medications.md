### Insulin tropic
- [[Sulphonylureas]], [[Meglitinides]] act on Potassium Channels
- [[GLP-1 Agonists]], [[DPP-4 inhibitors]] stimulate insulin secretion, delay gastric emptying 

### Non-insulinotropic: No hypoglycemia 
- [[Metformin]], [[PPARÎ³ Activators]] improve [[Insulin resistance]] 
	- Improve lipid profile 
- [[Alpha-Glucosidase inhibitors]] delay Glucose absorption
- [[Amylin analogue]] decrease [[Glucagon]] release, Delays gastric emptying, promotes satiety
- [[SGLT-2 Inhibitors]] decrease glucose reabsorption in [[PCT]] 
- [[Dopamine Agonists]] 

### Contraindications
- [[Type 1 DM]]
- [[Pregnancy]] and [[Lactation]]
- [[CKD]] with [[GFR]] < 30 ml/min  
- [[General Anesthetics]] 
- Acute stressors requiring hospitalization
