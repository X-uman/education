- Deficiency: [[Glanzmann thrombasthenia]] 
 - [[Antiplatelet agents]] 
 - Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors bind to and block glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors ([[fibrinogen]] receptor) on the surface of activated platelets → prevention of [[platelets]] binding to fibrinogen → inhibition of [[platelet aggregation]] and [[Thrombosis]]
 - Indications:
	 - [[Unstable angina]], [[NSTEMI]] Planned for [[PCI]] within 24 hrs.

	- Acute profound [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]] and [[hemorrhage]]
- C/I:
	- [[Hypersensitivity reaction]]
	- Recent [[hemorrhage]], major [[Trauma]]
