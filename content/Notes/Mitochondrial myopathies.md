### Pathophysiology
- All abnormalities lead to impaired [[Oxidative phosphorylation]] 
- Decreased [[ATP]] production
- Upregulated [[Glycolysis]] and overproduction of pyruvate which leads to accumulation of lactate and alanine
- High energy requiring organs are affected
- Muscle biopsy shows red ragged fibers which are caused by sub-sarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar accumulation of defective mitochondria in muscles (mitochondria stain red).
- Normal [[Creatine Kinase]]
