### Introduction
- Uncommon clinical presentation of breast cancer
- Most often presents as an eczematous / erythematous change of the nipple areolar skin
- Cutaneous manifestation is due to tumor cells involving the epidermis and disrupting intercellular junctions
- Underlying high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma is present in > 95% of patients
- Majority of Paget cells and associated underlying carcinoma are HER2+

### Pathophysiology
- 2 theories on the pathogenesis:
   - **Epidermotropic theory** (most widely accepted): Paget cells are DCIS cells that migrate along the basement membrane of the nipple, supported by the presence of DCIS deeper in the breast identical to Paget cells in almost all cases; migration may be mediated through a motility factor heregulin Î±, produced by keratinocytes and exerting its effect via the HER2 receptor
   - **Transformation theory**: Paget cells originate from malignant transformation of keratinocytes or Toker cells; it would explain rare cases (< 5%) in which cancer is not present in underlying breast
- When no parenchymal cancer is identified, there is a possibility that the underlying tumor has gone undetected / unsampled

### Pathology
- The histologic hallmark of PDB is **the presence of Paget cells**, which are malignant, intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells of variable sizes usually large in size, present singly or in the form of small groups within the epidermis of the nipple.
- Tumor cells involve the junction between the nipple stroma and epidermis, without invasion across the basement membrane. 
- This disruption causes the exudative skin changes. It is classified as a form of ductal carcinoma in situ, owing to the lack of invasion. However, Paget disease can be associated with an underlying invasive carcinoma.
- Underlying dermis may have chronic inflammation
- Epidermis with hyperkeratosis and possibly ulceration
- Paget cells may phagocytose melanin, mimicking melanocytes
- Underlying carcinoma is most commonly high grade invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST; 53 - 64%) or DCIS (24 - 43%)

### Presentation
- Commonest: Nipple redness, scaling crust, ulceration, [[Eczema]]-like rash, pruritus, or bleeding
- [[Pagets disease vs Eczema breast.png]] 
- Less common: bloody nipple discharge, pain, retraction or no clinically identifiable changes of the nipple
- Changes begin at the nipple / areola and may spontaneously regress or continue to progress with extension into the skin of the breast
- Approximately 50% of patients present with an associated palpable mass, usually indicating an underlying invasive carcinoma
- Affected men have similar clinical presentations as women
- Clinical presentation may be mistaken for skin inflammatory disease or infection, leading to delayed diagnosis

### Diagnostics
- Symptomatic: Clinical diagnosis and confirmation by [[Tissue diagnosis]]
- Common techniques: Skin punch or shave, *see [[Assessment of breast lump]] 
- Nipple scrape cytology can detect tumor on surface of epidermis or scale crust but may be painful to patient and rarely done
- Biopsy of underlying mass, if present usually by core needle 
- Radiology
	- [[Mammography]] for detecting masses, distortion or calcifications
	- USG may show ductal ectasia or nipple-areolar complex changes
	- MRI: sensitive for occult diseases
- Majority are HER2 positive
