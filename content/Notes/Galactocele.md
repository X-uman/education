### Introduction
- Aka milk retention cyst
- Primarily occur during or shortly after lactation
- Most common benign breast lesion in lactating women who have recently stopped [[Breastfeeding]] 
- **Mechanism**: Obstruction of lactiferous duct → distention of the duct due to collection of milk and epithelial cells → cyst formation
### Clinical presentation
- firm nontender or mildly tender breast mass
- Size may fluctuate
- Severe pain and tenderness indicates secondary infection
### Diagnostics
- USG: 
	- simple anechoic cyst to a mass with internal echoes
	- Posterior acoustic enhancement
	- **Fat-fluid level**
	- Irregular borders and wall thickening
- Mammography if USG inconclusive
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)">oil-fluid cyst</span> is pathognomonic for galactoceles
	- Heterogenous density
- Image guided FNAC
	- Done if inconclusive imaging, suspected infection or pain
	- Findings: Milky aspirate
	- Complications: Milk fistula 
### Management
- Asymptomatic galactoceles typically regress and can be managed expectantly.
- Symptomatic galactoceles often require fine needle aspiration and drainage catheter placement, and in the case of infection, antibiotic therapy. 
- Drainage catheter placement: often recommended to facilitate fluid removal
- Repeated needle aspiration increases the risk of infection but is typically required before a galactocele fully resolves. The placement of a catheter to allow continued drainage facilitates resolution
### Prognosis
- Good prognosis
- No risk of malignant transformation
