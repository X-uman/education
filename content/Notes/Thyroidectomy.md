### Preoperative preparation
- Render patient euthyroid if [[Thyrotoxicosis]] using
	- Carbimazole 10-15 mg TDS, when the patient becomes euthyroid in ~4 weeks then maintained at 5-10 mg
	- Propranolol 80 mg QID 4-7 days before operation
	- [[Lugol's iodine]]: 2 weeks pre-operatively to reduce vascularity 

---
### Hemostasis
- Artery ligation: 
	- Both superior and inferior thyroid arteries are ligated close to the gland.
	- Inferior artery gives many branches before entering the gland, each should be ligated 
	- Previously, inferior artery was ligated far from gland to avoid injury to [[Recurrent laryngeal nerve]]
	- but it also cuts off blood supply to [[Parathyroid glands]]

### Complications
- Hemorrhage
- [[Tetany]] 
	- In 1st 3 days: due to corrected thyrotoxicosis
	- After 1 week due to [[Hypoparathyroidism]] leading to [[Hungry bone syndrome]] 
- [[Surgical site infection]] 
- Nerve injuries
	- #commonest is External Laryngeal Nerve
	- [[Recurrent laryngeal nerve]]:  [[Vocal cord palsies]]
	- internal laryngeal nerve
	- [[Ansa cervicalis]]
