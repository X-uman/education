### Introduction
- Cystic neck swelling developing due to sequestration of a portion of jugular lymph sac from the lymphatic system in intrauterine life
- Strongly associated with fetal aneuploidy (e.g., Turner syndrome, trisomy 21) and congenital malformations (e.g., congenital heart defects)
- congenital lymphatic cyst (macrocystic lymphangioma) in the posterior triangle of the neck caused by malformation and obstruction of the fetal lymphatic system
- They cyst does not communicate with lymphatics, thereby preexisting lymph gets absorbed and the cyst is filled with clear **watery or mucous fluid** derived from its lining 
### Clinical presentation
- Can present as a cause of [[Obstructed labor]] during delivery 
- Present at birth as a soft, compressible, painless, posterior triangle [[Neck swellings]]  
- Can cause dysphagia or airway compromise
- Positive [[trans-illumination test]]
- Size increases on crying
- Common sites:
	- [[Posterior Triangle]]
	- Axilla
	- Tongue
	- Groin
	- Mediastinum
- Often multiple sites are involved

### Diagnostics
- [[Antenatal USG]] shows fluid-filled neck mass with or without septations
- USG after birth can also be done 
- CT/MRI for further assessment for surgical planning
- Variants
	- Lymphangioma circumscripta
	- L. diffusum
	- L. ab agne (reticulate pattern) 
### Management
- Small lesions: regress spontaneously but surgical excision is usually indicated to prevent infection or airway compromise, as well as for cosmesis.
- Large lesion: Surgical excision
	- Preoperative [[Sclerotherapy]] helps in easier excision 
	- Initial aspiration of the contents is done followed by excision of the sac after it is thickened by fibrous tissue
	- If Respiratory obstruction develops: [[Tracheostomy]]
- Abscess formation: Incision and Drainage
- Small masses may regress spontaneously, 
- [[Tonsillectomy]] also needed if they are involved
- Recurrence is common following surgical excision of extensive hygromas.
