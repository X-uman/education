### Fluid challenge (TROL)
- Identify type of fluid
- Choose rate and volume
- Identify objective
- Set limits
	- Avoid [[Fluid overload]]
	- Objective parameters

##### rates and volume 
- Standard fluid challenge (examples) but should be tailored as per patient's risk of volume overload
    - Adults: 100–200 mL over 5–10 minutes OR 250–500 mL over 15–20 minutes
    - Children: 5–15 mL/kg over 5–10 minutes
- Mini fluid challenge: 100 mL over 1 minute, This strategy has shown a high sensitivity and specificity for fluid responsiveness. 

- Signs of fluid responsiveness
	   - ≥ 10–15% increase in cardiac output (CO) or stroke volume (SV)
	   - ∼ 12% change in pulse pressure
	   - Vital signs
		  - Increase in systolic blood pressure
		  - Normalization of heart rate and respiratory rate
	   - Increase in urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hour
