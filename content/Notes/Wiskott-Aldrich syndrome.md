 - Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an x-linked immunodeficiency that causes T-cell dysfunction. 
 - WASP-encoding gene mutation
 - WAS Protein is involved in [[Cytoskeleton]] dependent responses including cell migration and signal transduction
 - WAS can manifest with a prolonged bleeding time, but a low platelet count would also be expected.
 - [[Antigen presentation]]
	 - [[atopy]]
	 - [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura]]
	 - [[opportunistic infection]], Autoimmune disease and [[Neoplasms]] 

- Combined humoral and cellular immunodeficiency
 - Onset since birth
 - WAS Triad
	 - Thrombocytopenia: Micro thrombocytes
	 - [[Eczema]] due to atopy
	 - Recurrent bacterial infections

 - Reduced IgM levels: [[IV Immunoglobulins]] therapy
 - Normal IgG levels
 - IgA and IgE are elevated
 - Prophylactic [[Antibiotics]]: for infections
 - [[Stem cell transplantation]]: curative
