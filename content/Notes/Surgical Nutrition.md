- Early enteral feeding is thought to decrease the risk of infectious complications by decreasing gastrointestinal dysmotility, gut permeability, and the risk of bacterial translocation. Complete bowel rest, which was previously recommended, is unnecessary in most patients. Success has been demonstrated with various types of diet (liquid, low-fat, and full solid). 
- No superiority between nasogastric and nasojejunal tube has been demonstrated, but nasojejunal feeding may be more appropriate for patients with vomiting, gastroparesis, or gastric outlet obstruction, provided that the tube can be passed into the jejunum. 
- [[parenteral nutrition]] or Partial nutrition is given only in patients who cannot tolerate enteral feeds
- Bowel rest is no longer routinely recommended. Enteral nutrition, via oral route or enteral tube, should be initiated as early as tolerated
- All patients who have sustained or who are likely to sustain 5 d of inadequate oral intake should be considered for nutritional support

### Assessment of nutritional status
- Weight loss 
- [[Anthropometry]] 
- Albumin, 
- pre-albumin, Retinol binding protein and transferrin are more sensitive markers
### Nutritional requirement
- [[Resting energy expenditure]] x Stress factor
- Normal REE: 20-30 kcal/kg/day
- Stress factor: 1.2-2 in injuries
- 40% calories should come from fats
- Glucose
	- is the preferred carbohydrate source. Avoid [[Hyperglycemia]] because patient already has [[Insulin resistance]] as part of metabolic response to injury 
	- Provide energy as mixtures of glucose and fat.
	- obligatory glucose requirement to meet the needs of the central nervous system and certain hematopoietic cells, which is equivalent to about 2 g/kg per day
- RDA values of vitamins and minerals
- Protein: 1.1, 1.5, 2.0 respectively in mid moderate and severe stress

### Routes
- [[Enteral nutrition]] 
- [[parenteral nutrition]]

### Nutrition in burn patients
- in burn patients to prevent gastric mucosal damage, in burn > 20% TBSA, start in < 6hrs using NG tube
- [[Curreri formula]]
	- Kcal = 25 x BW + 40 x %TBSA (16-59 years old)
	- Kcal = 20 x BW + 65 x %TBSA (>59 years)
- [[Sutherland formula]]
- [[Davie's formula]]
- Pediatric age group
	- Galveston formula
	- Brooke formula
*TBSA = Total burn surface area*
