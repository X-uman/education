### Introduction

### Etiology
- Postinfectious autoimmune disorder
- Post-urethritis
	- Chlamydia (common) or 
	- Ureaplasma urealyticum
- Post-enteritis:
	- Streptococcus
	- Shigella, Yersinia, Salmonella, or Campylobacter 
- In rare cases: after infection with [[Bartonella henselae]] 
- Occurs 1-3 weeks after initial infection
- May progress to [[Reiter syndrome]] 

### Pathogenesis
- Immune mediated T-cell attack due to molecular mimicry 

### Presentation
- Follows GIT or UTI infection
- Young male adults
- Sudden onset of joint pain, at least one month in duration
- Classic triad of reactive arthritis (seen in approximately one-third of affected individuals): “can't see (conjunctivitis), can't pee (urethritis), can't walk with 1 knee (arthritis)”
	- [[Arthritis]] which resembles that of [[Rheumatic fever]] 
		- Big joints, MC is Knee
		- Both axial and peripheral joints are involved, like axial spine, [[Sacroiliitis]]
		- Peripheral: [[Dactylitis]], [[Enthesitis]] 
		- Assymmetrical
		- Migratory 
		- More in lower extremities
		- Small joints can be involved 
	- Urethritis: [[LUTS]] irritative symptoms
	- [[Conjunctivitis]]
- ###### Dermatological
	- [[Balanitis circinata]]: skin lesions of the glans resembling [[psoriasis]] 
	- [[Keratoderma blenorrhagicum]]: hyperkeratinization of the palms and soles 
- ###### Constitutional symptoms
	- Fatigue
- **Reiter syndrome**
	- Dysuria, prostatitis, cervicitis
	- Incomplete Reiter: 2/3 seen
### Diagnostics
- Made clinically 
- Stool culture, Blood culture
- Urethral swabs of [[STI]] 
- Sterile pyuria
- Exclude differential diagnosis like RF, Infection
- X-ray: Erosion and osteophytes 
- MRI for enthesitis 
- ECHO: Regurgitation
- ECG: AV blocks, pericarditis 
- Slit lamp examination 
- HLA-B27 testing 

### Managements
- First line: NSAIDS
- Second line: Steroids
- Chronic (> 6 months) or severe: DMARDS
- Antibiotics for precipitating infection 
### Prognosis
- Self resolving
- High rate of recurrence
