 
#### Mechanism of action
  - activation of the transcription factor PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor of gamma type in the nucleus) → 
	  - ↑ transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism → 
	  - ↑ levels of adipokines such as [[adiponectin]] and insulin sensitivity → 
	  - ↑ storage of fatty acids in adipocytes, 
	  - ↓ products of lipid metabolism (e.g., free fatty acids) → ↓ free fatty acids in circulation → 
	  - ↑ [[Glucose transporters]] and ↓ hepatic [[Gluconeogenesis]] 

### Indications: 
- may be considered as monotherapy in patients with severe renal failure and/or contraindications for insulin therapy 

### ADRs
- Weight gain 
- [[Heart failure]] 
- Liver damage 
- [[Osteoporosis]]
- [[Fluid overload]] 
- Pioglitazone: Increased risk of Bladder cancer
