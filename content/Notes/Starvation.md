### 1st stage (2-3 days)
- [[Glycogenolysis]]
- [[Gluconeogenesis]]
- [[Glucagon]] 
- Major sources: [[Ketones]] and [[fatty acid oxidation]] 

### 2nd stage (depends upon fat content)
- 90% energy from fat, 10% from protein
- [[Lipolysis]] 
- Fat burning: lowered [[Respiratory quotient]] 

### 3rd week (< 1 week)
- When fat stores deplete and body derives energy from [[Protein catabolism]] alone
- [[Digestive enzymes]] followed by [[Muscle proteins]] are first to be utilized
- Lasts for < 1 week and leads to death 

### Metabolic response
- Reduced [[Resting energy expenditure]]
