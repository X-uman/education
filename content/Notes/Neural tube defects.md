### Risk factors
- [[Folic acid (B9)]] deficiency
- Family history 
- [[Sodium Valproate]] 

### Pathogenesis
- NTDs are caused by incomplete closure of the neural tube during neurulation, which takes place during the 3rd and 4th week after conception.
- Cranial defects: incomplete closure of anterior neuropores → cranial cleft formation (mostly open defects) with involvement of the skull and brain
- Spinal defects: incomplete closure of posterior neuropores → bone defects of the vertebral arches (mostly lower lumbar or sacral region) → possible herniation of spinal neural tissue and meninges
### Types
- Open or closed NTDs
- [[Anencephaly]]
- [[Encephalocele]] 
- [[Craniorhachischisis]] 
- [[Iniencephaly]] 
- [[Spina bifida]]
- [[Myelomeningocele]]
- [[Holoprosencephaly]] 
- [[Hydraencephaly]] 

### Diagnostics
- Open neural tube defects
	- Elevated [[Alpha Fetoprotein]] in maternal blood between 14 & 16 weeks or in amniotic fluid
	- Acetyl cholinesterase estimation
- Most accurate: [[Antenatal USG]] 
	- USG head, meningocele, and abdomen
	- [[Polyhydramnios]] 
- Chest and spine X-rays

### Complications
- [[Notes/Hydrocephalus]] 
- [[Congenital talipes equinovarus]] 
- [[Abdominal wall defects]] 
- [[Neurogenic bladder]] 

### Treatment
- Early closure within 72 h of delivery to prevent infections and [[Ventricular shunts]] 
- Closed lesions: Monitoring and possibly elective surgery
- [[Lorber's criteria]] #todo/Study  

### Pregnancy
- Folate supplementation in pregnancy: according to the US Preventive Services Task Force 
- 400–800 μg/day for all women planning or capable of pregnancy (at least 4 weeks prior to conception)
   - Women with a history of a previous pregnancy resulting in an NTD
	  - 400–800 μg/day when no pregnancy is planned
	  - 4 mg/day when pregnancy is planned (at least 4 weeks prior to conception)
   - Intake should be continued through the first trimester.


### Differential diagnoses
- [[tethered spinal cord syndrome]] 
- [[Congenital dermal sinus]]
