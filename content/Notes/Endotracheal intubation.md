### Procedure
- Make sure [[Endotracheal tube set]] is fully available and in working condition
- STOP MAID


### Procedure
- [[Rapid Sequence induction]] 
- Orotracheal: Commonest
- Naso-tracheal
	- #contraindications any maxillofacial fracture, base of skull fracture, cribriform plate fractures
- [[ATLS]] latest guidelines include usage of Videolaryngoscopy 
	- [[Flexible Fiberoptic intubation]] 

### Testing
- Bilateral chest expansion
- Misting of ET-tube with each expiration
- Auscultation
	- Chest: BL breath sounds
	- Epigastrium: gurgling sound indicates tube has gone into esophagus
- [[Capnography]] is **best indicator** of proper position, improvement of vitals  
- [[Bronchial intubation]] is evident by increase in peak inspiratory pressure 
- Airway USG, Radiology, Bronchoscopy 
- Pediatric X-ray not helpful 
	- Tip should be at lower border of body of T2 (just above carina)
[[Extubation]]
