### Introduction
- [[Autoimmune diseases]] 
- [[Chronic Inflammation]] 
- Male preponderance 
- Age < 16 y
- Duration > 6 weeks 
- Rheumatoid factor absent in most cases, except Seropositive polyarticular JIA
- ANA: MC associated with Oligo-articular JIA, increased risk of anterior uveitis
- Most cases resolve by puberty
### Stem
- Oligo-articular 
	- 4 or less  joints involves [[Weight bearing joints]] asymmetrically with BL Chronic [[Anterior uveitis]] 
- Polyarticular 
	- Seronegative: [[Cervical spine]] & [[TMJ]] also affected + Chronic Anterior Uveitis, [[ANA]] positive
	- Seropositive:  Symmetrical, with [[rheumatoid nodules]] 
- Systemic
	- [[Arthritis]] + [[Inflammation]]: Fever x 2 weeks, at least 3 consecutive days + [[JIA systemic features]] 
- Psoriatic & [[Enthesitis]]-related: [[HLA-B27]] association
- Triggered by infection, antibiotic exposure in childhood

### Management 
- [[DMARDS]] 
- Avoid [[Glucocorticoids]]: [[Catabolism]] and [[Growth impairment]] 
- [[JIA systemic features]] 
- [[Slit-lamp examination]]

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]
- [[Reactive arthritis]]
- [[Rheumatic fever]] 
- Juvenile [[Ankylosing spondylitis]] 
- [[Connective Tissue Disease]] 
- [[Trauma ]]
- [[Hemophilia]]  


- Factors associated with a poor prognosis
    - Early onset
    - Prolonged active systemic disease
    - Hip and/or wrist involvement
    - Polyarticular involvement
    - Symmetrical disease
    - Presence of RF
    - Presence of anti-CCP antibodies

## Analogy
- [[Fever with rash]] 
- [[Chronic bronchitis]]
