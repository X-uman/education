##### Complications
- Shunt infection
	- Most commonly with gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis)
	- Management: shunt removal
- Shunt obstruction: [[Tube-related complications]] 
- Underdrainage: can lead to elevated ICP
- Over-drainage: can lead to intracranial hypotension syndrome
- Slit ventricle syndrome: ventricular collapse and shunt obstruction due to chronic CSF over-drainage
