### How to know curettage has been complete?


### In molar pregnancies
 - Uterine evacuation consists of mechanical dilation of the cervix, followed by suction aspiration (regardless of uterine size), and then sharp curettage to help assure complete evacuation of molar tissue.
 - Electric and manual suction evacuation are comparable in terms of their effectiveness for complete evacuation and in side effects
 - Use of ultrasound guidance is recommended to ensure complete evacuation of uterine contents
 - transabdominal fundal massage can facilitate uterine contraction if the uterus is sufficiently above the pelvic brim
 - hysterectomy or uterine artery embolization may be needed for emergency management of acute hemorrhage
 - risk of bleeding increases with uterine size, blood for transfusion should be available
 - gentle sharp curettage should be performed to remove any residual molar tissue
 - second curettage may not lower the risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia
