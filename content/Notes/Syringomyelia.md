### Introduction
- [[Central cord syndrome]] 
- Fluid filled cavity in the central canal of Spinal cord
	- Syringobulbia if it happens in Brainstem
- [[Space Occupying Lesion]] 
- [[Mass Effect]] on sensory, motor and autonomic tracts 
	- Decussation of [[Lateral spinothalamic tract]] and [[Anterior spinothalamic tract]] 
	- [[Corticospinal tracts]] 
		- leading to [[UMN Lesions]] below the level of syrinx 
		- [[Anterior horn]] cells damage leading to [[LMN Lesions]] at segment level 
	- Descending hypothalamic fibers in T1-4 or Nucleus of Budge– BL [[Horner Syndrome]]
	- Advanced disease: [[Dorsal column]] also involved 
	- extends to Medulla: [[Syringobulbia]] 

### Causes
- [[Arnold-Chiari malformation]], especially type I (most common cause)
- Posttraumatic SCI (3–4% of patients with SCI develop symptomatic syringomyelia) e.g. [[Whiplash injury]] 
- Post-inflammatory: [[transverse myelitis]], [[arachnoiditis]]
- Post-infectious (meningitis)
- Intra-medullary tumors: [[ependymoma]], hemangioblastoma
- Scoliosis
- Other congenital malformations: [[tethered spinal cord syndrome]]
- Idiopathic

### Presentation
- Cape-like distribution of symptoms if C4-6 affected
- Dysthetic pain: Fluctuating radicular pain
- Dorsal column not affected: [[Dissociated sensory loss]] 
- [[Neuropathic arthropathy]] especially in Shoulders
- Scoliosis
- However, sensations around the sacral region will usually be spared.

### Management
- Conservative therapy is usually sufficient, but definitive surgical treatment is recommended for patients with progressive neurological symptoms.

### Surgical treatment
- Removal of the tumor (if present)
- Decompression by drainage of CSF fluid from the cavity
	- Cerebral [[shunts]] (see in “[[Notes/Hydrocephalus]]”)
	- Laminectomy and syringotomy 
	- Suboccipital and cervical decompression 
	- Neuroendoscopic decompression
	- Terminal ventriculoscopy (indicated in patients without Chiari malformation)

### Supportive therapy
- Physiotherapy and psychotherapy
- Spasticity: [[baclofen]], [[methocarbamol]]
- Analgesia: [[amitriptyline]], NSAIDs, [[gabapentin]] (not FDA-approved for use in syringomyelia, but may be considered due to its effectiveness in treating neuropathic pain) [4]
