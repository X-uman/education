- Thyroid nodules are any discrete lesion that can be delineated on imaging studies from the adjacent thyroid parenchyma.
### Etiologies
- See [[Thyroid swelling (Goiter)]] 
##### Red flags for malignancy

| Characteristics          | Family History & Symptoms          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| - Male sex               | - MEN2 syndrome                   <br> - Differentiated thyroid cancer (i.e., papillary, follicular, or medullary thyroid cancer) <br> - History of radiation to the head or neck |
| - Age: < 14 years or > 70 years | - [[Gardner syndrome]]         <br> - Rapid growth of thyroid nodule <br> - Recent onset of persistent hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea |
|                          | - Palpatory Findings:             <br>   - Firm or hard nodule <br>   - Fixed nodule <br>   - Cervical lymphadenopathy |

### Approach
- Initial tests: [[Thyroid function tests]] 
- Subsequently
	- TSH low: [[Thyroid scintigraphy]] and refer to endocrinologist if it is hot nodule
	- High/Normal TSH/Cold nodule: [[Thyroid ultrasonography]], then [[Thyroid FNAC]] if indicated 
- Criteria of FNAC
	- Suspicious nodule >= 1 cm
	- Large nodule >= 1.5 cm
	- Evaluate risk factors for malignancy
