### Indications
- [[Traumatic brain injuries]] with GCS score <= 8 and structural brain injury on CT
- Head injury with high risk of progression like large contusions or [[Coagulation panel]] disorder
- [[Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage]]
- [[Intracranial infections]]
- [[Fulminant liver failure]]
- [[Notes/Hydrocephalus]]
- [[Stroke]]
- [[CNS tumors]] 
- [[Transtentorial herniation]]
- Significant [[Intraventricular hemorrhage]] or [[Notes/Hydrocephalus]] 

### Measurement
- [[Transcranial doppler]]: Increased flow velocity from narrowed cerebral arteries
- Direct ICP monitoring
	- [[External ventricular drain]] is #gold-standard  
	- Parenchymal: [[Camino Fiberoptic ICP monitor]]
	- Subdural: Miniature strain gauge
	- Epidural
	- Fontanometry
	- Lumbar pressure is not preferred because:
		- Chances of [[Brain Herniation]]
		- Does not reflect in [[Notes/Obstruction|Obstruction]] 

- [[External ventricular drain]] 
- [[Camino Fiberoptic ICP monitor]] 
- [[Miniature strain gauge]] 
- Spiegelberg parenchymal transducer
- Hummingbird synergy
- Telemetric ICP monitoring
- Compliance monitor

- Non-invasive methods: 
	- USG: Optic nerve sheath diameter (USG better than MRI or CT measurement for diagnostic accuracy)
	- Ophthalmodynamometry: Measures Venous opening pressure
	- Cochlear fluid pressure?
	- Transcranial doppler: MCA is considered a biologic pressure transducer
	- Delayed in [[Visual evoked potentials]]
