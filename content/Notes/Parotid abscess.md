### Introduction


---
### Etiology


---
### Pathogenesis
- Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis may occur when salivary stasis permits retrograde seeding of the Stensen's duct by mixed oral flora. 
- Ductal obstruction by calculi or tumor may predispose to suppuration. 
- Abscess formation may arise by contiguous infection or hematogenous seeding to the intraparotid or periparotid lymph nodes
