### Definition
 a potentially life-threatening complication of ovulation induction with exogenous human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)

### Pathogenesis
- Massive [[luteinization]] of ovarian granulosa cells
- Formation of multiple ovarian follicles and [[Corpus luteum cysts]] with rapid ovarian enlargement
- Release of vasoactive mediators e.g. [[VEGF]] 
- Increased [[Capillary permeability]] and third spacing into abdominal cavity, pleural space
- [[dehydration]]
- [[Hemoconcentration]]

### Presentation
- onset between 3 days (early onset) and â‰¥ 9 days (late onset) after hCG administration
- Abdominal pain
- [[Ascites]]
- Features of [[hypovolemia]] 
- [[venous thrombosis]]

### Diagnostics
- CBC: Hemoconcentration
- Electrolyte imbalance
	- [[Hyponatremia]]
	- [[Hyperkalemia]]
- Prerenal [[AKI.canvas|AKI]]
- Elevated liver enzymes
- USG: Ascites and ovarian enlargement

### Management
- Early onset: mild to moderate cases
	- Pain management with NSAIDs
	- Daily weight gain monitoring 
	- Urine output
	- Sufficient hydration
	- Paracentesis to relieve ascites
- Late onset: usually severe
	- Hospitalization
	- Fluid resuscitation
	- [[Thromboprophylaxis]] 

### Complications
- Sepsis
- Thromboembolism
- Pericardial effusion
- Arrhythmias
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Acute kidney injury
