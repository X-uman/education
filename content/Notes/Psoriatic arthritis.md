##### Clinical patterns
- Oligoarthritis with swelling and tenosynovitis of one or a few hand joints, 70% 
- Asymmetrical DIP joint involvement with nail damage, 16% 
- [[Arthritis mutilans]] with osteolysis of phalanges and metacarpals, 5% 
- Symmetrical polyarthritis-like rheumatoid arthritis, with claw hands, 15% 
- Ankylosing spondylitis alone or with peripheral arthritis, 5%

### Diagnostics
