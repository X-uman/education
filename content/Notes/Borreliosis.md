**Epidemiology:**
- Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the US.
- It's primarily found in the Northeast and upper Midwest regions of the US.

**Etiology:**
- Borrelia burgdorferi is the pathogen in the US; B. afzelii and B. garinii are more common in Europe and Asia.
- Tick vectors include Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus in the US, and Ixodes ricinus in Europe.
- White-footed mice are the primary reservoirs of B. burgdorferi in the US.

**Clinical Features:**
[[Borreliosis]] 
- Lyme disease has three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late disseminated.
- Early localized disease presents with erythema migrans and flu-like symptoms.
- Early disseminated disease may involve neurological symptoms, migratory arthralgia, and cardiac manifestations.
- Late disease can lead to chronic arthritis, late [[neuroborreliosis]], [[acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans]], and other manifestations.

### Clinical presentation
- Rash resembling [[Primary syphilis]]
- Late symptoms: [[Arthalgia]] like [[Secondary syphilis]]
- Cardiac manifestations: [[Heart blocks]] 
- Commonest Neurological manifestation: [[Facial nerve palsy]]
- [[Lyme meningitis]] 

**Diagnostics:**
- Clinical diagnosis is sufficient for erythema migrans; serology is recommended for other presentations.
- Serology involves ELISA or indirect fluorescent antibody tests, with confirmatory testing if initial results are positive or equivocal.
- Culture: Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium
- Polymerase chain reaction is useful in joint fluid examination 
- Lumbar puncture if suspected meningitis

**Treatment:**
- Antibiotic treatment varies based on disease stage and severity, with options including oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil, and intravenous ceftriaxone for severe cases.
- Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) may be necessary after a tick bite in selected cases.

**Complications:**
- Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) can lead to nonspecific symptoms lasting over 6 months after successive treatment, with no established effective therapies.

**Other Cutaneous Manifestations:**
- Borrelial lymphocytoma and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans are rare manifestations primarily seen in Europe and Asia.

This summary captures the key points regarding Lyme disease, its clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and potential complications. Let me know if you need further clarification on any specific aspect!
