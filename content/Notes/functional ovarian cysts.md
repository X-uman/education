| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Follicular cysts]]    | - Develop when a follicle in the ovary fails to rupture or release its egg during ovulation, causing it to grow larger and form a cyst.                                      |
| [[Corpus luteum cysts]] | - Occur when the follicle releases its egg during ovulation but then seals off and fills with fluid instead of dissolving, forming a cyst.                                   |
| [[Theca-lutein cysts]]  | - Associated with high levels of [[Î²-hCG]] , commonly seen in multiple gestation pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and conditions where there is excessive stimulation of hCG. |
| [[Endometrioma]]        | Chocolate cyst inside the ovary due to endometriosis                                                                                                                         |
| [[PCOS]]                | Multiple cysts measuring 2-9 mm (String of pearls appearance) due to failure to ovulation                                                                                    |
| Hemorrhagic cysts       | - Form when bleeding occurs within a functional cyst, often due to the rupture of blood vessels within the cyst wall.                                                        |
### Clinical features
- Small in size, generally < 6 cm 
- Asymptomatic
- Spontaneously regress following treatment of underlying cause
- Unilocular
- Contain clear fluid inside unless hemorrhage occurs
- Lining epithelium is the functional epithelium from where it originates
