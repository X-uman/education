### hCG discriminatory zone
- The discriminatory zone is the serum hCG level above which a **gestational sac** should be visualized when an IUP is present
- For TVUS, we use a discriminatory zone of 3510 mIU/mL
- In patients with an intrauterine [[multiple gestation]], the serum hCG level will be higher than anticipated for a singleton pregnancy, and yet, ultrasound examination may not reveal an IUP
### causes of high b-hCG
- First exposure: overreaction of body
- [[multiple gestation]] 
- [[Hydatidiform mole]]
- [[Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia]] 
- Ectopic production: [[Germ cell tumors]] 

### Effects
- [[Hyperemesis gravidarum]] 
- [[Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy]] early in pregnancy (<20 weeks)
- [[Hyperthyroidism]] subclinical 
- [[Theca-lutein cysts]]

### Differential diagnoses of elevated hCG
- Pregnancy
- Choriocarcinoma
- [[Germ cell tumors]]
- neoplasms, including stomach, liver, pancreas, breast, as well as myeloma and melanoma
- pituitary hCG or a false-positive test (phantom hCG)
