The presence of fetal vessels directly over the internal cervical os and below the presenting part of the fetus. These vessels are typically unprotected by placental tissue or the [[umbilical cord]] and may bleed following [[rupture of membranes]], resulting in fetal exsanguination. 
Risk factors for vasa previa include placental anomalies (e.g., bilobate or succenturiate placenta and [[velamentous cord insertion]] of the umbilical cord), [[placenta previa]], [[multiparity]], and [[in-vitro fertilization]].
