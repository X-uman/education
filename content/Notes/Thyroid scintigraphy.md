#### Thyroid scintigraphy 
- Indication: thyroid nodule(s) in a patient with low TSH
- Contraindications: pregnant and breastfeeding women
### Findings and interpretation
- Cold nodule (hypo-functioning nodule): Evaluate for indications for FNAC of thyroid nodules with ultrasound.
- Hot nodule (hyperfunctioning nodule): rarely malignant, FNAC not recommended 
	- Solitary hot nodule: toxic adenoma
	- Multiple hot nodules: toxic multinodular goiter
