### Definition
- Acute heart failure: rapid onset of new or worsening signs and symptoms of heart failure 
- Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF): acute heart failure due to decompensation of preexisting disease/cardiomyopathy (most common) 
- [[De novo heart failure]]: acute heart failure occurring for the first time in a patient without known cardiomyopathy (âˆ¼15% of cases)

### Clinical features
- Congestion: Wet
- Hypoperfusion: Cold 
- None: Dry and warm
- Both: may be in [[cardiogenic shock]] 

### Diagnostics
- Primarily clinical, obtain [[Natriuretic peptides]] if uncertain
- Evaluate for possible triggers
- Obtain CXR/Lung USG to confirm [[Pulmonary edema]]
- Obtain [[EKG]] and [[cardiac biomarkers]] for underlying causes
- Obtain [[Echocardiography]] with suspected decline in cardiac function or any de novo heart failure

### Management
- Morphine no longer recommended 
##### stable patients

| Steps | dry and warm | Wet and warm             |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
|       | Optimize     | [[Oxygen therapy]]       |
|       |              | Treat [[Fluid overload]] |
|       |              | [[Nitrates]]             |
##### Unstable patients
- Can present with
	- [[cardiogenic shock]] (BP < 90 OR decreased [[end-organ perfusion]] )
	- [[Hypertensive emergency]] 

| Steps | Dry and cold                                           | Wet and cold                 | Wet and warm due to Flash pulmonary edema |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|       | [[Fluid Challenge Test]]                               | [[Oxygenation]]              | NIPPV and vasodilators                    |
|       | Add Vasopressors and inotropes if refractory to fluids | Consider [[Inotropic drugs]] | Treat hypertension, arrhythmia, ACS, VHD  |
### Ongoing management
- [[Lifestyle modifications]] 
- Fluid restriction does not reduce hospitalization or mortality rates in patients with HF. 
- Sodium restriction 
- Discontinue/avoid any cardiotoxic medications (e.g., NSAIDs, morphine)
- Identify and treat comorbidities (e.g., atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, COPD) and underlying triggers.
- [[Thromboprophylaxis]] 
- For large volume ascites, consider therapeutic paracentesis
