 The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) is a standardized system developed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) for interpreting and reporting findings from mammography, breast ultrasound, and breast MRI. It provides a structured framework for communicating breast imaging findings and recommendations. Here's a breakdown of the BI-RADS categories:

| BI-RADS Category |                                | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                | Incomplete                     | Additional imaging evaluation is needed, such as additional mammographic views or ultrasound. |
| 1                | Negative                       | The mammogram is negative, and there are no suspicious findings.                              |
| 2                | Benign                         | Findings are definitely benign, with no indication of malignancy.                             |
| 3                | Probably Benign                | Findings are likely benign, but a short-term follow-up is recommended to ensure stability.    |
| 4                | Suspicious                     | Findings are suspicious for malignancy, and further evaluation with biopsy is recommended.    |
| 5                | Highly Suspicious              | Findings are highly suspicious for malignancy, and immediate biopsy is recommended.           |
| 6                | Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy | Findings have been previously biopsied and confirmed as malignant.                            |
