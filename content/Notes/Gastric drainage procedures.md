- Truncal [[vagotomy]] necessitates a gastric drainage procedure to prevent gastric stasis.
- Gastric drainage procedures aim to bypass or divide the pyloric sphincter mechanism for improved gastric emptying.
- Pyloroplasty is the preferred method, widening the opening between the antrum and duodenum.
	  - Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty: divides the sphincter longitudinally and closes it transversely; simplest and most common.
	  - Finney pyloroplasty: divides the pyloric sphincter.
	  - Jaboulay pyloroplasty: bypasses the pyloric sphincter.
- Gastrojejunostomy anastomoses the dependent stomach portion to the proximal jejunum, typically reserved for specific patient populations, who have significant duodenal bulb scarring that precludes safe pyloroplasty.

### Considerations
- Severe ulcer disease causing [[Gastric Outlet Obstruction]] often results in a non-pliable duodenum unsuitable for pyloroplasty.
- In rare cases with minimal fibrosis or confined fibrosis, a Finney pyloroplasty may be considered.
- Foreshortening of the first part of the duodenum may favor a Jaboulay pyloroplasty (latero-lateral gastroduodenostomy) as a better alternative.
  - **Jaboulay pyloroplasty** is gaining popularity due to its technical simplicity and anastomosis performed in healthy tissue away from the ulcer bed.
- Although a randomized trial suggested that gastrojejunostomy might be superior to Jaboulay pyloroplasty, the latter remains a viable option.
- If closure of the duodenal stump is challenging, a posterior gastrojejunostomy without antrectomy can provide adequate drainage, preferably including biopsy of the ulcer.
- Despite potential concerns about exacerbating gastroparesis in a chronically obstructed stomach, vagotomy should still be considered in conjunction with gastrojejunostomy.
