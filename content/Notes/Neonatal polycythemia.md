[[polycythemia]] 
A hematocrit > 65% or hemoglobin > 22 g/dL in a neonate. Neonatal polycythemia is more commonly seen after delayed umbilical cord clamping, chronic fetal hypoxia, or placental insufficiency (e.g. in diabetic mothers). Most infants are asymptomatic, some show poor feeding, cyanosis, or neurological symptoms due to associated hyperviscosity of the blood.
