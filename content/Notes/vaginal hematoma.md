### Management
- If stable, these hematomas can be watched, but if they are enlarging or if bleeding continues, they too should be opened, evacuated, and the bleeding points ligated. Vaginal packing with a povidone iodine-moistened gauze may be helpful for tamponade.
- the possibility of retroperitoneal bleeding from torn and retracted vessels must also be considered if the patient becomes unstable'
- Interventional vascular procedures for embolization of vessels are rarely indicated. If surgical management fails to control bleeding of an opened vaginal hematoma, emergency use of fibrin sealants may be an option
