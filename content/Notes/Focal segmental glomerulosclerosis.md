Here is the structured information from your note with appropriate headings:

---

### Focal Disease
- May miss the disease in biopsy.
- Missed biopsy may point towards [[Minimal Change Disease]], but do not respond to corticosteroids.
### Etiology
- Idiopathic
- HIV
- Heroin
- Sickle Cell Disease
- Obesity
- IgA Nephropathy
- Renal Ablation
- Reflux Nephropathy
- Renal Transplant
- Gene Mutation (Podocin, Î±-actinin-4, TRPC6)
### Pathological Findings
- **Light Microscopy:**
  - Hyalinosis and sclerosis of part of some glomeruli with collapse of loops.
  - Thickened afferent arteriole (AA).
- **Electron Microscopy:**
  - Focal detachment of podocytes.
  - Denuded underlying glomerular basement membrane (GBM).
  - Diffusely effaced foot process.
### Immunofluorescence
- IgM and C3 deposits in sclerotic areas and mesangium.
### Clinical Features
- Common in adults, Blacks/Hispanics.
- Selective/Non-selective proteinuria.
- Less response to corticosteroids, does not recur.
- Renal failure in 20% of cases.
- Severe cases may present with hematuria.
- Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
### Prognosis
- Later stages may involve more glomeruli, complete sclerosis, and increased mesangial matrix.
- Poor response to corticosteroids, bad prognosis, renal transplant needed.
- End-stage renal disease (ESRD) may develop within 10 years.
- Better prognosis in children.
