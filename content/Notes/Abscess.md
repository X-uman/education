   - An abscess that is not caused by infection
   - May form as a complication of subcutaneous/intramuscular injection when the injected substance (e.g., glucocorticoids, synthol, oils) is not absorbed and causes persistent irritation or as a result of ongoing inflammation in a previously septic abscess after the causative pathogen has been cleared.
