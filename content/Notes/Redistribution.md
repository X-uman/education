- redistributionÂ from the highly perfused CNS into other (more slowly perfused) body tissues, including fat
- repeated intravenous doses lead to prolonged anesthesia because fatty tissues act as a long-term storage reservoir
- fat stores accumulate thiopental in concentrations 6 to 12 times greater than the plasma concentration, and then release the drug slowly to cause prolonged anesthesia
