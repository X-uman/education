Contraceptive efficacy: defined by unwanted pregnancy in spite of using contraceptive

### Pearl Index
- measures failure rate of contraceptives as failures per 100 women years of exposure
- If a women uses a method for 8 months, gets pregnant twice during that time, then pearl index would be
	- For 12 months, 2 x 12/8 = 3 times in 12 months or 1 year
	- For 100 women, 3 x 100 = 300 pregnant women
	- In 100 women years, they will be pregnant 300 times
- Total unwanted pregnancy/months of use x 1200
- Total accidental pregnancy/no of menstrual cycles x 1300
- Total accidental pregnancies per life time of reproductive age (25 years)=Pearl index/4

How many times a woman would be pregnant If she used it for 100 years?

### Life Table Analysis
- Calculate failure for each month
- Best for calculating efficacy

### Unmet Need:
- Eligible couple where wife does not want to be pregnant, but they are not using any contraception
- Reason for such condition could be lack of education, religion, economic factors, societal norms, inconvenience, lack of services, etc. that is the environmental factors.

### Couple protection rate
- % of eligible couples protected by family planning method
- Normally, there are 150-180 eligible couple per 1000 population
- Target couple: Families with one child or newly married couples=Family planning applied
- CPR= Eligible couples using FP/Total E.C. x 100

### Effective CPR
- Also considering effectiveness of FP methods
- Effectiveness
	- Condoms: 50%
	- IUD: 95%
	- OCP: 100%
	- Sterilization: 100%
