1. [[Inhalational anesthetics]] 
2. [[Intravenous Anesthetics]] 
- [[Inducing Agents]] 
### Mechanism 
- [[GABA receptors]] Potentiation: 
	- Reduces [[Blood Pressure]] Except [[Etomidate]] 
	- [[Intracranial pressure]] by reducing [[cerebral perfusion]] 
	- [[respiratory depression]] 

- [[NMDA]] receptors Blockage: [[Ketamine]] 
	- [[Dissociative analgesia]]
	- [[Psychotomimetic effects]]
	- [[Sympathetic Overdrive]] 
	- Increased [[cerebral perfusion]] 

- Effects of anesthesia
	- Loss of consciousness
	- Analgesia
	- Amnesia 
	- Muscle relaxation / paralysis

- Monitoring
	- [[Mechanical Ventilation]]
