### Functions
- Active form: tetrahydrofolate (THF), obtained after reduction of folate by dihydrofolate reductase
- Folate: coenzyme in single-carbon transfers and methylation reactions → DNA synthesis and amino acid metabolism
### Etiologies for deficiency
- Decreased intake
- [[Malabsorption syndrome]]
- Increased requirement
	- Pregnancy/lactation
	- [[Notes/Hemolysis|Hemolysis]] 
- Drugs
	- [[Methotrexate]]
	- [[Anti-Epileptic therapy]] 
	- [[Sulfonamides]]
	- [[Sulfasalazine]] 
	- [[Trimethoprim]] (Blocks folate conversion to tetrahydrofolate)
### Pathophysiology
- ↓ DNA synthesis → megaloblastic erythropoiesis → megaloblastic anemia (and ↓ in other cell lines) 
- ↓ Methionine and ↑ homocysteine → endothelial damage → ↑ risk of cardiovascular disease and thromboembolic events  
- During fetal development: nucleotide synthesis impairment → [[neural tube defects]]
- Aberrant [[DNA methylation]] → ↑ risk of cancer

### Clinical features
- [[Megaloblastic anemia]] 
- [[Glossitis]]
- [[Neural tube defects]] 
### Diagnostics
- Features of megaloblastic anemia but Normal levels of methyl-malonic acid
- [[Hyper-homocysteinemia]] 
- Folate serum levels are not reliable

### Therapeutic considerations
- [[Neural tube defects]] 
	- 0.4 mg per day: To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, women should take a folate supplement, starting 4 weeks before conception and throughout the first trimester
### Antagonists
- [[Methotrexate]] 
- [[Sulfonamides]]
- [[Leucovorin]]
