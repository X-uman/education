### Indications (all of following should be present)
- Treatment with [[Dilation and evacuation]] 
- High risk of developing GTN
	- Complete mole positive (i.e. they have signs of trophoblastic proliferation, uterine size greater than gestational age, serum human chorionic gonadotropin hCG levels >100,000 milli-international units/mL, and ovarian theca lutein cysts >6 cm in diameter, and are age >40 years).
- [[Serial Î²-hCG]]  is either unavailable or unreliable, which is a particular consideration in global areas that are resource-limited.

| Eight-Day MTX Regimen | 1,3, 5, 7          | MTX dosed at 1 mg/kg IM or IV on days 1, 3, 5, and 7, with folinic acid (FA) administered 24 hours after each MTX dose (weight-based or fixed dose);<br> FA 7.5 mg on days 2, 4, 6, and 8.                               | - Effective in inducing remission for low-risk GTN.<br> - Some patients may prefer a modified schedule to avoid dosing on weekends.<br> - FA dose must balance toxicity and effectiveness.                                  |
| Five-Day MTX Regimen  | 5 days for 2 weeks | MTX dosed at 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg IM or IV for five consecutive days every two weeks;<br> no folinic acid administered.                                                                                                      | - Efficacy similar to eight-day regimen. <br>- May be preferred at some centers.<br> - Maintenance of dose intensity is crucial for efficacy.                                                                               |
| Weekly MTX Regimen    | weekly             | Weekly IM injection of MTX at a dose of 30 to 50 mg/m2 until serum hCG becomes undetectable (<5 mIU/mL),<br> followed by consolidation therapy.                                                                          | - Widely used in the United States.<br> - Cost-effective when considering efficiency, toxicity, and cost. <br>- Longer time to achieve remission compared to other regimens.                                                |
| High-Dose MTX Regimen |                    | Initial therapy with high-dose MTX infusion (100 mg/m2 IV push followed by 12-hour continuous infusion at 200 mg/m2),<br> with FA administered orally every 12 hours for six doses starting 24 hours after MTX infusion. | - Lower complete remission rate but shorter duration of treatment compared to other regimens.<br> - Particularly useful for patients living far from treatment centers.<br> - FA must be administered to mitigate toxicity. |
