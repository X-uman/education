- Fetus not getting proper space inside [[uterus]] or birth canal or being manipulated
- A twisted neck due to abnormal fetal positioning (e.g., breech babies) or birth trauma leading to unilateral fibrosis and contracture of the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]], most commonly the right one. 
- Typically detectable by 2-4 weeks of age with a well-circumscribed mass on the involved SCM and head tilted to one side, once the child has developed some head control. 
- Associated with facial asymmetry (in comparison to acquired torticollis). Usually resolves spontaneously by 2-6 months of age.
