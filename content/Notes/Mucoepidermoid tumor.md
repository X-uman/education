### Introduction
- MCC of malignant tumor of [[Parotid Gland]]
- 30% have Lymph node [[Metastasis]]
- [[Human Papillomavirus]] 16, 18 associated
- CRTC1/MAML2 fusion transcript, which arises from the CRTC1/MAML2 translocation, is a molecular marker unique to mucoepidermoid carcinoma 

### Presentation
- **F > M** (3:1)
- Slowly increasing mass, eventually attaining a large size
- Hard, nodular and involves skin and lymph nodes
- Pain, facial nerve involvement seen in high grade tumors

### Diagnostics

#### Pathology
- Involves squamous and mucinous cells, both of which arise from excretory stem cells
##### Staging

### Management
- Surgery
	- T4 and High grade: Radical [[Parotidectomy]]
	- T1,T2,T3 of low grade: Total parotidectomy
- Radiotherapy
	- Useful in high grade tumors
	- Perineural spread
	- Deep lobe tumor
	- Vascular involvement
	- Close or inadequate clearance margin
- Chemotherapy
	- Intra-arterial route is most beneficial
