The ABCD² score is a clinical tool used to assess the risk of stroke following a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The score helps predict the likelihood of stroke in the days following a TIA and guides clinical decision-making regarding further evaluation and management.
### ABCD² Score Components
The ABCD² score is based on five factors:
1. **Age**
2. **Blood Pressure**
3. **Clinical Features**
4. **Duration of Symptoms**
5. **Diabetes**

### Scoring Criteria

| **Factor**                      | **Criteria**                       | **Points** |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| **Age**                         | ≥ 60 years                         | 1          |
| **Blood Pressure**              | Systolic ≥ 140 mm Hg or Diastolic ≥ 90 mm Hg | 1          |
| **Clinical Features**           | Unilateral weakness                | 2          |
|                                 | Speech impairment without weakness | 1          |
|                                 | Other symptoms                     | 0          |
| **Duration of Symptoms**        | ≥ 60 minutes                       | 2          |
|                                 | 10-59 minutes                      | 1          |
|                                 | < 10 minutes                       | 0          |
| **Diabetes**                    | Present                            | 1          |

### Total ABCD² Score
The total ABCD² score ranges from 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of stroke following a TIA.

### Interpretation of the ABCD² Score

| **Total Score** | **2-Day Stroke Risk** | **7-Day Stroke Risk** | **90-Day Stroke Risk** |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 0-1             | 1.0%                  | 1.2%                  | 3.1%                  |
| 2-3             | 1.3%                  | 3.1%                  | 6.0%                  |
| 4-5             | 4.1%                  | 9.8%                  | 11.7%                 |
| 6-7             | 8.1%                  | 17.8%                 | 22.2%                 |

### Clinical Application
- **Score 0-3 (Low Risk, 1%)**: Outpatient management may be considered with follow-up within 24-48 hours.
- **Score 4-5 (Moderate Risk, 4%)**: Hospital admission or urgent outpatient evaluation and observation are recommended.
- **Score 6-7 (High Risk, 8%)**: Hospital admission for immediate evaluation and management is recommended.
- Score > 6 needs secondary prevention
- Score < 4 associated with minimal risk
