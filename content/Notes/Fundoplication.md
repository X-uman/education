### Transoral incisionless fundoplication 
- TIF is a way to treat GERD symptoms without surgery by restoring the natural reflux barrier. If fundoplication is not a suitable option for someone, doctors may choose the TIF procedure.
- During TIF, a surgeon uses a special tool called the EsophyX device. They insert the device into the mouth and down the esophagus. The device creates skin folds at the bottom of the esophagus to create a new stomach valve that prevents stomach acid reflux.
- Although an individual requires anesthesia, the necessary recovery time is minimalTrusted Source because there are no incisions.
