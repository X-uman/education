### Types
| Type               | Description                                       | Associated Signs/Features                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transient Ischemia | Temporary interruption of blood supply to a nerve | Temporary loss of sensation or motor function due to reduced blood flow.                     |
| Neuropraxia        | Segmental demyelination of nerve fibers           | Temporary loss of nerve function without axonal damage. Often resolves spontaneously.        |
| Axonotmesis        | Injury involving disruption of axons              | Positive Tinel sign indicating nerve regeneration.                                           |
| Neurotmesis        | Complete disruption of nerve fibers               | May result in neuroma of injury, where regenerating nerve fibers form a mass or scar tissue. |
- Axonotmesis
	1. Loss of axonal continuity only
	2. Loss of Axonal + endoneurium
	3. Loss of A + E + Perineurium, but intact epineurium 

### Causes
- Laceration
- Pressure
- During manipulation
- [[Nerve entrapment]] 

### Presentation
- Loss of motor function
	- Loss of grip strength
	- Loss of dexterity
	- Clumsiness
	- Difficulty lifting
	- Muscle atrophy
- Sensory symptoms
	- Loss of sensation
	- parasthesia
	- referred pain

### Assessment
- History
- [[Tinel sign]]
- Motor examination 
- [[Electromyography]] 
- [[Strength duration curve]] 
- [[Nerve conduction studies]]
