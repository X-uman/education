### Ebb phase
- Happens during injury
- Corresponds to a state [[Notes/shock|shock]]
	- Hypovolemia
	- Hypotension
	- [[Hypothermia]] 
	- [[Lactic acidosis]] 
	- Hypoxemia
	- Hypoglycemia
- Leads to death if severe and patient is not resuscitated
- Emergency hormones come into play and rescue the patient from death
	- [[Catecholamines]]
	- [[Cortisol]]
	- [[Aldosterone]] following [[RAAS]] activation in response to [[hypovolemia]] 
- Patient needs resuscitation 
- Lasts 1-2 days
### Flow phase
- Evolves following resuscitation of patient
- Corresponds to [[SIRS]] but later may go into opposite state of [[Counter-inflammatory response]] 
- Has 2 phases
	- Catabolic phase in first 3-10 days
	- Anabolic/recovery phase for next 10-60 days
		-  may last for weeks following serious injury

### Mediators
- [[Hypothalamic stress response]] 
- [[SIRS]] 
- Regulated by [[Counter-inflammatory response]] release which acts to limit response of the body 
- Interactions between Metabolic, neuroendocrine and cytokine aces:
	- Cortisol is immunosuppressive, acts synergistically with IL-6 to promote hepatic acute phase response.
	- ACTH release is enhanced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and Noradrenergic system, resulting rise in Cortisol may form a weak feedback loop attempting to limit the pro-inflammatory stress response.
	- Hyperglycemia may aggravate the inflammatory response via substrate overflow in the mitochondria, cause formation of excess free oxygen radicals and altering gene expression to enhance cytokine production.
