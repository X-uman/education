### Scoring
| Risk Level        | Management                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-risk ≥ 7     | - Inpatient admission <br> - Obtain invasive coronary angiography during admission                                                                                                                                    |
| Intermediate-risk | - Noninvasive testing (e.g., cardiac stress test or coronary CT angiography) usually required prior to discharge <br> - In patients with recent negative workup for CAD, no further testing needed prior to discharge |
| Low-risk ≤ 3      | - No further testing needed prior to discharge from the ED <br> - Ensure outpatient follow-up <br> - Outpatient coronary artery calcium scoring may be considered for ASCVD risk evaluation                           |
