### Introduction
- [[Seronegative spondyloarthropathies]]

### Association
- HLA-B27 

### Pathophysiology
- The mechanism for triggering innate immunity is unclear, but is thought to be associated with pathogens invading the systemic circulation via disruption in the gut mucosal barrier. 
- Release of 
	- [[TNF-a]]
	- [[TGF-beta]] 
	- [[Interleukin-17]]
	- [[Interleukin-23]] 
- [[Enthesitis]] infiltration in paravertebral and [[Sacroiliitis]] 
	- [[Radiological markers of Chronic arthritis]] 
	- Erosion
	- [[Syndesmophytes]]
	- Fusion of syndysmophytes

### Presentation
 - Lower back pain for > 3 months in patients < 45 years of age and one of the following
- Inflammatory back pain
	- Morning stiffness > 1 h 
	- Pain at night 
	- Pain decreases with activity  
- [[Sacroiliitis]], Neck pain possible
- Ankles, hips and knees possible
- [[Enthesitis]], [[Dactylitis]] 
- Mild fatigue
- Positive family history 
- Other joints involved: Fingers, hip
- Pain relieved within 1-2 days of NSAIDs use
- Extra-articular manifestations
	- [[Anterior uveitis]], [[Scleritis]] 
	- [[Pulmonary fibrosis]] in upper lobe 
	- Associated [[IBD]]
	- [[Prostatitis]]
	- Aortic root inflammation and subsequent 
		- [[Aortic regurgitation]]
		- [[Heart block]] 
	- [[IgA Nephropathy]] 
	- [[IBD]], [[Psoriasis]] 
	- [[Spinal stenosis]] 
	- [[Secondary osteoporosis]]
- [[Bath AS severity index]] 
##### Examination
- [[Sacroiliitis]] 
- [[Spinal mobility]] 
- [[Kyphosis]] of thoracic spine which affects posture 

### Diagnostics
- Suspect AS in patients < 45 years of age who present with features of inflammatory back pain lasting > 3 months.
- [[Ankylosing spondylitis diagnostic criteria]] 
- X-ray
	- [[Radiological markers of Chronic arthritis]]
	- [[Sacroiliitis]] 
	- [[Kyphosis]]
- MRI
- HLA-B27
- [[Notes/Inflammatory markers|Inflammatory markers]] are raised
- Family history
- Negative RF, ANA
- CBC: Anemia 

### Differential diagnosis
- Other [[Seronegative spondyloarthropathies]]
- Mechanical
- [[Fibromyalgia]]
- [[Intervertebral disc prolapse]] 
- [[Vertebral Osteomyelitis]]
- [[Osteophytes]] of spine
- [[Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]] 

### Complications
- Ankylosis
- Osteoporosis
- [[Chalk stick fractures]]
- Apical [[Pulmonary fibrosis]]
- [[Restrictive lung disease]]
### Management
- 1st line: [[Pain management]] using NSAIDS, Steroids 
- Second line: [[TNF-a]] inhibitors
- Alternative: [[DMARDS]] like Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine for peripheral arthritis present 
- Advanced: [[tofacitinib]] 
- Surgeries
	- Hip arthroplasty
	- Spinal [[Osteotomy]] with kyphosis 

##### Non-medical treatment
- Physiotherapy
- Swimming exercise 
- Exercise
- Smoking Cessation

##### Surgical treatment
- Joint replacement surgeries
