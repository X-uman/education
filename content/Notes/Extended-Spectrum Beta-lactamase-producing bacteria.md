- Urinary tract infections by [[Extended-Spectrum Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria]] such as Klebsiella pneumoniae requires a different drug therapy because the beta-lactamases produced by these pathogens confer resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics (including penicillins, cephalosporins & monobactams). Infection by ESBL-producing bacteria has been associated with poor outcomes. Failure to treat with an antibiotic with in vitro activity against cultured isolates during the first 5 days after obtaining culture results has been associated with an increased mortality (64 vs 14%) (Munoz-Price & Jacoby, 2011).
	- Treatment with a carbapenem has produced the best outcomes in terms of survival. Recommended options include (Munoz-Price & Jacoby, 2011)
		- Meropenem
		- Ertapenem
