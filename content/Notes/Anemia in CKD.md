### Pathogenesis
- Reduced Erythopeitin
- Reduced life span of RBCS
- [[Uremia]] toxic effect on precursor cells
- Nutritional deficiency
- [[Hyperparathyroidism]] and bone marrow fibrosis
- Reduced intake and utilization of Iron due to Hepcidin synthesis (happens in chronic diseases)
- Capillary fragility and poor platelet function

- Manage correctable causes of anemia.
	- Obtain diagnostic studies for iron deficiency.
	- Consider evaluation for underlying causes of iron deficiency (e.g., GI bleeding).
	- Consider iron therapy for iron deficiency anemia in patients with TSAT < 30% and ferritin < 500 ng/mL. 
	- Check for and potentially treat vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency.
- Consider erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs): for patients with Hb < 10.0 g/dL  [33]
	- Treatment target: usually Hb concentration between 11 and 12 g/dL (without intentionally exceeding 13 g/dL) 
	- Measure TSAT and ferritin at least every 3 months to determine if adjunctive iron replacement therapy is needed.
	- Adverse effects include increased risk of thrombosis, an increase in blood pressure, and headache.
	- Avoid blood transfusions: particularly in patients eligible for renal transplantation (risk of alloimmunization)
