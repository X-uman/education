### Notes
- Simultaneous administration of Nitrous oxide an another potent anesthetic, its induction will be faster
- Wind of diffusion of N2O drags other gases along its diffusion vector
- N2O having low blood solubility rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes alveolar air. 
- So partial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced resulting into hypoxia called diffusion hypoxia. 
- This can be prevented or reduced by administering 100% [[Oxygen]] immediately following anesthesia
