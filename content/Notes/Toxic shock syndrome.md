### Etiology
- Toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria, but the condition may also be caused by toxins produced by group A streptococcus (strep) bacteria
### Presentation
- Features similar to [[Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis]]
- Severe [[SIRS]] 
- Rash looking like [[sunburns]] on palms and soles
- Also causes Mucus membrane damage
- [[Acute liver failure]]
- [[Acute Kidney Injury]]

### Management
- Intravenous fluid requirements may be high, and albumin replacement may be required in the setting of capillary leak syndrome associated with streptococcal TSS
- [[IV Immunoglobulins]] recommended in streptococcal TSS 
- The combination of clindamycin and IVIG is likely efficacious by reducing circulating toxins produced by GAS
