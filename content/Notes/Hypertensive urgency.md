- Asymptomatic patients: No immediate intervention is required.  
- Nonspecific symptoms (e.g., isolated headache, nonspecific dizziness, epistaxis)
- Move the patient to a quiet room for 30 minutes followed by repeat BP measurement. 
- If symptoms persist and are attributable to high BP: Consider a rapid-acting oral antihypertensive agent. 
	- Clonidine  0.1–0.3 mg PO once
	- Captopril 25–50 mg PO once
	- Labetalol 200–400 mg PO once
	- Prazosin 5–10 mg PO once
- Monitor the patient for a few hours to ensure BP and symptoms improve.
#### Subsequent management
- New hypertension: 
	- Evaluate for [[Secondary hypertension]]
	- Refer OPD management
- Known hypertension: Dose titration
- All patients
	- Follow up in 1 week
	- Ensure drug compliance
