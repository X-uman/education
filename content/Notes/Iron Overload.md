### Monitoring organ damange
- Endocrinopathies: Screen patients for the following conditions and refer to endocrinology as needed.
- [[Diabetes Mellitus]]: Monitor fasting glucose every three months and carry out glucose tolerance test once a year. 
- Hypothyroidism/hypoparathyroidism annually
- Hypogonadism if signs of [[Delayed puberty]] 
- Osteoporosis: [[DEXA]] biannually 
- Liver cirrhosis and carcinoma: liver chemistries (every 3 months) and MRI (annually)
- Cardiac siderosis: regular imaging (echocardiogram or MRI)

### Management
The risk of iron overload for each patient is typically evaluated by a specialist (e.g., when serum ferritin reaches ∼ 1000 mcg/dL, or after ∼ 12–15 transfusions) and balanced with the risk of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity due to chelating agents. Some patients require higher and more frequent doses in rescue or emergency situations. 
- Deferasirox
- Deferoxamine
- Deferiprone
