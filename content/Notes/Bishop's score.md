- Definition: a scoring system used to assess the cervix and the likelihood of successful induction of labor

PEDCS 

| Scoring Parameter        | 0 points  | 1 point         | 2 points    | 3 points |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Cervical **Position**    | Posterior | Midline         | Anterior    |          |
| Cervical **Consistency** | Firm      | Moderately firm | Soft (ripe) |          |
| Cervical **Effacement**  | ≤ 30%     | 31–50%          | 51–80%      | > 80%    |
| Cervical **Dilation**    | Closed    | 1–2 cm          | 3–4 cm      | ≥ 5 cm   |
| Fetal **Station**        | -3 cm     | -2 cm           | -1/0 cm     | +1/+2 cm |
- Interpretation 
	- Bishop score ≥ 8: favorable cervix (ready for vaginal delivery)
	- Bishop score ≤ 6: unfavorable cervix (not ready for vaginal delivery)
- Alternative: simplified Bishop score
	- Considers only fetal station, cervical dilation, and cervical effacement
	- A score of ≥ 5 indicates a favorable cervix.
