- Risk factor: [[immunocompromised status]] 
### Microbiological profile

### Diagnostics
- An elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is often used as a clinical indicator of possible PCP in individuals with HIV.
- The definitive diagnosis of PCP requires identification of the organism either by tinctorial (dye-based) staining, fluorescent antibody staining, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays of respiratory specimens. 
- The most rapid and least invasive method of diagnosing PCP is by analysis of sputum induced by the inhalation of hypertonic saline 
- BAL: Silver stain and immunofluorescence show **disc shaped yeast**
- Direct fluorescent antibody staining using a fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody can visualize both trophic forms and cysts and is the most common technique used.
- Beta-D-glucan is a cell wall component of all fungi, including _Pneumocystis_.
- CT-scan
	- Ground-glass attenuation: symmetrical, diffuse, interstitial infiltrates 
	- Pneumatoceles: cystic air-filled spaces within the lung tissue
- Patients with PCP rarely present with lung cavitations or pleural effusions on chest x-ray. If these findings are present, consider alternative diagnoses or additional pathology. [6]

### Management 
- Treatment: high dose TMP-SMX
	- Trimethoprim 15–20 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole 75–100 mg/kg/day PO in divided doses every 8 hour
	- A 21-day antibiotic course is recommended for most patients.
- [[Dapsone]] +/- [[Pyrimethamine]] can be used for treatment
- Prophylaxis is done if [[CD4 count]] < 200 cells/mm3
