### Risk factors
- Environmental factors
	- Exposure to nicotine during pregnancy
	- Bottle feeding: delayed gastric emptying increases load on pyloric sphincter 
- Genetic factors: Family history, Blood groups B, O
- Genetic anomalies
	- [[Eosinophilic gastroenteritis]]
	- [[Apert syndrome]]
	- [[Zellweger syndrome]]
	- [[Turner Syndrome]] and [[Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)]] 
- [[Macrolides]] 
	- Erythromycin and azithromycin are associated with a higher risk of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when administered within 2 weeks after birth
	- Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis associated with macrolide antibiotics should be reported to the FDA
### Presentation
- MCC of [[Gastric Outlet Obstruction]] in infants 
- Presentation in neonatal period
- First born male caucasian child
- Post-prandial projectile vomiting 
- Strong rooting and suckling reflex due to hunger after vomiting
- Palpable olive shaped mass in epigastrium: Firm, mobile 
- visible gastric peristalsis from left to right side
### Diagnostics
- USG abdomen
	- Pylorus > 4mm thick, > 14mm in length, 10-14mm in diameter 
- Barium studies: #todo/exam
	- Shoulder sign
	- Double tract sign
	- Mushroom sign
	- Teat sign
	- diamond sign
	- Caterpillar sign
	- String sign, Beak sign
- Laboratory: 
	- [[Hypochloremia]]
	- [[Hypokalemia]]
	- [[Metabolic alkalosis]] 
	- [[Paradoxical aciduria]] 
	- Hypo/hyper natremia due to dehydration

### Management
- Adequate [[Immediate hemodynamic support]] and electrolyte balance
- Frequent administration of small meals
- Head elevation
- Definitive treatment: [[Ramstedt pyloromyotomy]] is gold standard
- Others
	- Atropine before feeding to prevent vomiting
	- Endoscopic balloon dilatation

### Differential diagnosis of infant emesis
- [[Midgut volvulus]]
- [[GERD in infants]]
- [[Acute Gastroenteritis]]
- [[Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia]] with salt loss
- [[Cyclical vomiting syndrome]] 
- [[Neonatal emesis]]

### Adult variant
- Features of [[Gastric Outlet Obstruction]] 
- Due to [[Peptic ulcer disease]]
