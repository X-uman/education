### Presentation
- MCC is blunt injury
- Patient may have predisposing factor for [[splenic rupture]] 
- **Kehr's sign**: referred pain to left shoulder (Right shoulder in Liver injury)
- **Balance sign**: Unilateral shifting dullness

### investigations 
- CECT is the investigation of choice in stable patients
	- Grade 1, 2, 3: Conservative management
		- features of failure of conservative management: Tumor blush after 72 h --> Go for angioembolization 
	- Grade 4: >25% devascularized
	- Grade 5: Shattered spleen: Splenectomy
- e-FAST is the initial investigation of choice
- X-ray chest/abdomen is #obsolete  which might show following features: 
	- [[Rib fracture]] 
	- Left lung atelectasis
	- Obliteration of splenic outline and psoas shadow
	- Stomach gas pushed medially

### Severity Assessment

| Grade | laceration                 | subcapsular Blood collection                                         |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | < **1cm** of capsular tear | < **10%** surface area, < 1cm of parenchyma depth                    |
| 2     | 1-3 cm                     | 10-50% / < 5 cm intraparenchymal hematoma                            |
| **3** | > **3 cm**                 | **> 50%** / Ruptured hematoma / **> 5** cm intraparenchymal hematoma |
| 4     | > 25% devascularization    |                                                                      |
| 5     | Shattered spleen           |                                                                      |

### management 
- In patients with splenic injury who are hemodynamically stable, conservative management is warranted and consists of observation and frequent ultrasounds to monitor any further complications that may develop. 
- Laparotomy and partial splenic resection are indicated in peripheral splenic rupture. However, this procedure is most appropriate for hemodynamically unstable patients.
- [[Exploratory laparotomy]] and splenectomy are indicated for hemodynamically unstable patients with hilar rupture.
	- Grade 1, 2, 3: [[splenorrhaphy]]
	- Grade 4, 5: [[Splenectomy]]
