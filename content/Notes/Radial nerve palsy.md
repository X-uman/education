### Etiologies
| Location                     | Risk Factors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Axilla                       | Improper crutch use (crutch palsy)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Mid-arm                      | Fracture of humerus (radial nerve runs in spiral groove) <br> Compression of the radial nerve due to draping of arm over furniture (saturday night palsy) or pressure on the axilla or upper medial arm; more likely in the setting of intoxication, anesthesia, or sleep (honeymoon palsy) |
| Elbow                        | Radial tunnel syndrome (controversial diagnosis) due to chronic compression within the radial tunnel                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Deep forearm                 | Posterior interosseous nerve syndrome (a syndrome characterized by weakness of muscles in the extensor compartment of the forearm) due to fracture of the radial head or chronic soft tissue compression                                                                                    |
| Superficial forearm or wrist | Superficial radial nerve compression, called “cheiralgia paresthetica,” often due to tight wristwatches or handcuffs or repetitive pronation and supination                                                                                                                                 |

| Superficial forearm | Deficits on the radial side of the dorsum of the hand (thumb, index finger, and the radial half of the middle finger) | None                                              |
