- Malnourishment

### Diagnostics
- Clinical diagnosis
- Laboratory analysis
    - Electrolyte disturbances: [[hypokalemia]] and hypochloremic [[metabolic alkalosis]] or [[metabolic acidosis ]]
- Signs of [[dehydration]] (e.g., ↑ hematocrit)
- [[Ketonuria]]
- Ketoacidosis can develop due to starvation in patients with severe hyperemesis gravidarum. 

### Complications
