- significantly increased cerebral blood flow in women with severe preeclampsia compared with that of normotensive pregnant women (Zeeman, 2004b). Taken together, these findings suggest that eclampsia occurs when cerebral hyper-perfusion forces capillary fluid interstitially because of endothelial damage, which leads to **perivascular edema** characteristic of the preeclampsia syndrome. In this regard, eclampsia is an example of the [posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome].

- With CT imaging, localized hypodense lesions at the gray- and white-matter junction, primarily in the parietooccipital lobes, are typically found in eclampsia.
- Common findings are hyperintense T2 lesions. 
- ==There is also relatively common involvement of the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum==
- and although usually reversible, a fourth of these hyperintense lesions represent cerebral infarctions that have persistent findings
