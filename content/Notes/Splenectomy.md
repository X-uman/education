Give vaccines, against capsulated bacteria
- [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] (PCV)
- [[Hemophilus influenzae]] (HiB)
- [[Neisseria meningitidis]]
- [[Salmonella]] 

- Spleen should be removed after 6 years age. 
- After splenectomy, lifelong prophylactic antibiotics
- In addition to vaccination against these pathogens, which should occur either > 2 weeks before scheduled splenectomy or > 2 weeks after splenectomy, pediatric patients should also receive continuous antibiotic prophylaxis with oral penicillin or amoxicillin at least until the age of five years.
- A longer duration of antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered, especially in immunosuppressed individuals (e.g., with HIV infection, congenital immunodeficiencies, chronic liver disease). 

Types: 
- Total splenectomy
- Partial splenectomy

### Indications
- Treatment-resistant thrombocytopenia in [[Immune thrombocytopenia purpura]] 
- In thalassemia
	- Hypersplenism causing recurrent infections or bleeding
	- Clinically significant splenomegaly
    - Symptomatic (e.g., abdominal pain)
    - Massive splenomegaly (> 20 cm) at risk of [[splenic rupture]]
	- Uncontrollable iron overload disease
	- Uncontrollable anemia affecting growth and development 

### Complications
- Howell jolly bodies: Chromatin fragments: Seen in splenectomy and [[Crohn disease]]
- [[Asplenia]] 
- [[reactive thrombocytosis]] 
- [[subdiaphragmatic abscess]]
