- In healthy individuals, secretin inhibits gastrin secretion.
- In patients with gastrinomas, secretin causes a paradoxical and dramatic increase in the levels of gastrin within a few minutes of administering secretin.
- A two-fold increase in gastrin above the basal level is indicative of a gastrinoma.
- No increase or only a very slight increase is observed in cases of secondary hypergastrinemia. (Secondary hypergastrinemia refers to an increase in the levels of gastrin following achlorhydria (e.g., autoimmune gastritis, prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors), and/or hypercalcemia.)
