###### MOA
Pemoline increases the levels of dopamine in the brain by blocking the reuptake of dopamine into presynaptic neurons. This leads to an increase in the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, enhancing its neurotransmission. 
Dopamine is involved in regulating attention, focus, and impulse control, which are areas of difficulty for individuals with ADHD.

Additionally, pemoline may also increase the release of norepinephrine, another neurotransmitter that plays a role in attention and arousal. The increased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain are thought to contribute to the therapeutic effects of pemoline in ADHD.
