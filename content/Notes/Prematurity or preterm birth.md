### Nutrition
| Age            | Feeding Method                            | Reason                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 28 weeks     | [[parenteral nutrition]]                  | Gut is immature, unable to digest and absorb nutrients efficiently                                   |
| 28-31 weeks    | Orogastric tube feeding or gavage feeding | Rooting reflex not developed, unable to coordinate sucking and swallowing                            |
| 32-34 weeks    | Katori spoon feeding or paladai feeding   | Coordination between swallowing and breathing not fully developed                                    |
| After 34 weeks | Direct breastfeeding                      | Gut maturity allows for efficient digestion and absorption of breast milk                            |
|                | Non-nutritive sucking                     | Helps in the development of oral motor skills and facilitates transition to oral feeding             |
|                | Trophic feeds                             | Provides minimal enteral nutrition to stimulate gut development, reduce sepsis, and enhance immunity |

### Management
- [[Fetal neuroprotection]]

### Prevention
- Screening of [[Short cervical length]]
