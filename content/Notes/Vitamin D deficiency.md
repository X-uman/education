### Causes
- Impaired cutaneous synthesis 
- Inadequate dietary intake
- Decreased absorption: [[Malabsorption syndrome]] 
- Impaired [[Vitamin D activation]] 
- Defective activation: Competition for Liver and Kidney Hydroxylase: [[phenytoin]], also accelerates degradation 
- [[Chronic liver disease]] and [[CKD]] which impair activation

### Clinical manifestations
- Mild or moderate deficiency: [[Osteoporosis]] 
- Severe, chronic deficiency
	- In adults: [[osteomalacia]]
	- In children: [[rickets]] 
	- Symptoms of [[hypocalcemia]] (e.g., tetany)

### Screening
- Screening is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with:
	- Causes of impaired metabolism of vitamin D
	- Causes of impaired absorption of vitamin D
	- Nephrotic syndrome
	- Malnutrition 
- Also consider screening in the following populations:  [2][18]
	- Individuals with obesity
	- Pregnant and/or lactating women
	- Older adults with a history of falls or nontraumatic fractures
	- Individuals with darker skin pigmentation
- Screen using serum 25-OHD levels.
### Management/Prevention
- [[Vitamin D supplementation]]
