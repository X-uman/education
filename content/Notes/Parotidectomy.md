### Types
| Procedure                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conservative, partial, or limited superficial | Less extensive than a superficial parotidectomy; does not fully dissect the facial nerve                                                                                   |
| Superficial parotidectomy                     | Involves **resection** of the entire superficial lobe and **dissection** along all branches of the facial nerve                                                            |
| Total parotidectomy                           | Involves **dissection and preservation** of the facial nerve with removal of parotid tissue in the deep and superficial lobes                                              |
| Radical parotidectomy                         | Reserved for malignant parotid gland tumors; involves **extensive resection** including surrounding tissues and lymph nodes, often resulting in facial nerve **sacrifice** |


- Unless the facial nerve is directly involved by malignant tumor, every effort is made to protect and preserve its function.
- Total parotidectomy with resection of the involved portion of the facial nerve is typically performed for patients who present with facial nerve dysfunction or with clinical suspicion of tumor infiltration at operation.
- If possible, reconstruction of the nerve with interposition of a nerve graft or static procedures to mitigate facial droop should be done at the same procedure
### incisions 
- Lazy S incision or Modified Blair or Sistrunk incision

### cautions 
- Only use Bipolar [[diathermy]]
- If buccal branch of [[Facial nerve]] injured, reconstruct using Greater auricular nerve for cosmesis 

### complications
- Commonest Nerve injury Facial nerve leading to [[Facial nerve palsy]] 
- Commonest cutaneous nerve injured: Greater auricular nerve and [[Frey's Syndrome]]
- Hematoma 
- [[Flap]] [[necrosis]]
- Infection
- [[Keloid]] 
- [[Parotid fistula]]: repaired using [[Seabrooke Operation]] 
- Numbness in the distribution of the great auricular nerve including the ear, especially the lobule, and the face and neck is a common occurrence. Over time the majority of this will resolve, but permanent areas of numbness may occur
- First bite syndrome is a rare but very problematic complication of deep lobe parotid and parapharyngeal space dissections and is characterized by severe cramping or spasm in the parotid region with the first bite of each meal that diminishes over the next several bites
