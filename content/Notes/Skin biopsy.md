### General principles
| Biopsy Type                      | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shave Biopsy                     | Used for raised lesions. A thin layer of tissue is shaved off the surface of the lesion.          |
| Punch Biopsy                     | Used for large lesions. A cylindrical sample is taken from the most abnormal area of the lesion.  |
| Full-Thickness Excisional Biopsy | Preferred for lesions with pigmented features of BCC to rule out melanoma.                        |
| Complete Excision                | Considered as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for small lesions, with appropriate margins. |
- Ensure adequate sample size and depth (including the deep reticular dermis) for histopathological examination; if not, a repeat biopsy may be required.
