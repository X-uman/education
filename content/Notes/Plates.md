### Principles
1. Neutralization: resist torque and shortening
2. Compression: useful in metaphyseal fractures which heal without periosteal callus
3. Buttressing
4. Tension band: Convers bending force into compression force, which stimulated callus formation 
5. Antiglide
### Description
- Material
- Small/narrow/broad 
	- Broad: Zig-zag arrangement of holes
	- Narrow/small: Straight 
- Shape of hole
	- Single circular is Simple plate
	- Single oval oblique hole is Dynamic compression plate
	- Double holes, one locking is Locking compression plate 
- No. of holes 
- Low contact/conventional 
- Anatomical/non-anatomical plate
### Examples
1. [[Dynamic Compression plate]] 
2. 1/3rd tubular plate
3. [[Reconstruction plate]] 
4. [[Buttress plate]] 
5. [[Locking Compression plates]] 
### Special case 
1. [[Dynamic Hip Screw]] System
