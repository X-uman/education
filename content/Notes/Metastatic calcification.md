- Metastatic Calcification in Lungs(CO2 excretion, pH of Blood coming to lungs 7.4 and pH of Blood going out of Blood 7.35, so Calcium may deposit)
- Stomach (H+ production on lumen and HCO3- production in wall)
- Kidney (H+ production in Lumen and HCO3- in Interstitium)
- Arteries(more alkaline blood than veins) cells in these which produce acids produce conjugate base(Bicarbonate) on other side of cells, 
- Ca precipitates with Base in the Alkaline side of interstitium of these organs.
- [[Calciphylaxis]]: Walls of Blood Vessels in Limbs heavily deposited with Calcium and become Narrow--> Ischemic Injury to skin and tissue
