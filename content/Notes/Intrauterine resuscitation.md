### Maneuvers
- **Elevate presenting part**: While preparations for an emergency cesarean birth are made, the clinician places their hand in the vagina and gently elevates the fetal head until it is not compressing the cord.
- **Trendelenburg or knee-chest position**
	- gravity pulls the fetus and cord away from and cephalad to the internal cervical os, thereby alleviating cord compression. 
	- If Trendelenburg position is unavailable or the patient cannot assume a knee-chest position, a foam wedge below the maternal hips is an acceptable alternative.
	- Knee-chest position had the greatest effect in elevating the fetal head above baseline as measured by change in parasagittal angle of progression
- **By retrofilling the bladder**
- Administer a tocolytic: (intravenous ritodrine)
- **Consider manually replacing the prolapsed cord** 
	- After the fetal head is elevated with gentle suprapubic pressure or transvaginally or both, the cord is slipped over the widest part of the head and placed in the nuchal area. 
	- The head is then gently returned to its original position in the birth canal to decrease the chance of creating an oblique or transverse lie. 
	- Close attention to the fetal heart rate is required if attempting this maneuver, particularly if it while attempting vaginal delivery of a second twin.
