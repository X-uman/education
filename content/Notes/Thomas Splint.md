Discomfort due to ring: [[Bowler-braun Splint]]
The Thomas splint is usually applied in an emergency or pre-hospital setting before the patient is transferred to a hospital for further treatment. It provides temporary immobilization and helps alleviate pain and discomfort associated with femoral fractures. Once the patient reaches the hospital, more definitive treatment, such as surgery or casting, may be performed depending on the nature and severity of the fracture.
