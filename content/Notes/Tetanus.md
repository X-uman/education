- Resembles [[Strychnine]] in its effects
- Specifically blocks synaptic inhibition in the [[spinal cord]], that use [[Glycine]] and [[GABA]]
	- Protease: Breaks down [[SNARE Proteins]]
	- Inhibits fusion of vesicles of GABA and Glycine 
	- Stimulation of [[Alpha Motor neurons]] ([[Nerve fibers]])
- But differs from strychnine which acts Post-synaptic 
- by acting Pre-synaptic
- Abolition of Spinal Inhibition causes uncontrolled spread of impulses initiated anywhere in CNS: Hyper-responsiveness
- This leads in muscle [[rigidity]] and spasms due to simultaneous contraction of Agonists and Antagonists in the absence of Reciprocal Inhibition
- [[UMN Lesions]] 
- [[Localized tetanus]]
- [[Generalized tetanus]]
- [[Cephalic tetanus]] 
### Management
- [[Airway Management]]
- [[Tetanus prophylaxis]]
- Antibiotics: Metronidazole
- Symptomatic
	- [[Seizures]]
	- [[dehydration]]
	- [[Hypoxemia]]
	- Hyper-responsiveness
	- [[Autonomic dysfunction]]: Propranolol
