Infarcted cardiac myocytes release [[ATP]], which is converted to [[adenosine]] extracellularly by nucleotidases. Adenosine stimulates the adenosine A1 receptors on cardiac afferent nerve endings and is responsible for [[chest pain]] in patients with [[myocardial infarction]].

However, adenosine inhibits [[platelet aggregation ]]and induces vasodilation by stimulating A2A receptors; it would not cause [[thrombosis]] and [[vasoconstriction]], which are responsible for this patient's angiography findings.

Moreover, adenosine is not directly released from platelets. Adenosine diphosphate ([[ADP]]), which is released from the dense granules of platelets following platelet activation, would facilitate thrombus formation instead.
