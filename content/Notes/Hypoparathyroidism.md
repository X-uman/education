| Cause                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Surgically during [[Thyroidectomy]]                                    | Occurs when there's accidental removal of parathyroid tissue during surgery, particularly during thyroidectomy or radical neck surgery for carcinoma, which can be mistaken for lymph nodes.                                                                     |
| Excessive removal of Parathyroid tissue in Hyperparathyroidism patient | In cases of hyperparathyroidism, if there's excessive removal of parathyroid tissue during surgery, it can lead to hypoparathyroidism.                                                                                                                           |
| Congenital absence ([[DiGeorge Syndrome]])                             | DiGeorge Syndrome, a congenital disorder, can involve the absence or underdevelopment of the parathyroid glands among other symptoms.                                                                                                                            |
| [[Familial Hypoparathyroidism]]                                        | Inherited condition characterized by reduced PTH production. This condition can be associated with adrenal gland issues and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, also known as [[Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome]].                                              |
| Idiopathic Hypoparathyroidism                                          | This refers to cases of hypoparathyroidism where the cause is unknown. It can involve the presence of autoantibodies against calcium sensing receptors, which stimulate these receptors (as high blood calcium levels do), leading to reduced production of PTH. |
| Secondary to Chronic [[Vitamin D]] toxicity                            | Chronic toxicity from excessive vitamin D intake can lead to suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, resulting in hypoparathyroidism.                                                                                                                |
| Na channels                                                            | Dysfunction of sodium channels can also contribute to hypoparathyroidism, although the specific mechanism may vary depending on the context.                                                                                                                     |
| [[Pseudohypoparathyroidism]]                                           | Parathyroid hormone resistance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
