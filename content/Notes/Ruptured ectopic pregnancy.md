### Presentation
- More common in interstitial pregnancy 
- Severe pain, [[Notes/shock]] 
- Pain with guarding, [[features of retroperitoneal bleeding]] 
- PV: Cervical motion tenderness, fullness of posterior fornix 

### Diagnostics
- Evaluate for hemodynamic instability
- [[FAST scan]] for intraperitoneal bleeding: identification of intraperitoneal bleeding in a patient of reproductive age should be considered a potential ruptured ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise
- A hemodynamically unstable patient with this finding should undergo urgent surgical consultation and exploration
- If heavy vaginal bleeding is present and is thought to be the cause of the hypovolemia, the patient may require emergency surgical management with uterine aspiration for a suspected incomplete abortion
- A finding of fluid with debris (consistent with blood) in the pelvic cul-de-sac and/or abdomen may be consistent with rupture of an ectopic pregnancy. Blood clot may also surround the uterus and adnexa on the side of the patient's pain
