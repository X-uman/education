- [[Vitamin D metabolism]] to maintain Calcium and Phosphate levels
- [[Parathyroid hormone]] to maintain [[Calcium]] level
- [[Alkaline phosphatase]] activity required to deposit Calcium Phosphate, if they decrease, its activity increases to attempt compensation 

### Impaired bone mineralization present as
#### Children
- Diffuse bone tenderness 
- Deformities
	- Late closure of [[Skull Fontanelles]] 
	- [[Genu varum]], valgus, windswept deformity 
	- Craniotabes
	- Widened wrists 
	- Anterior bowing of tibia and femur
	- Pectus carinatum
	- [[Pathological fractures]] 
- Dentition: Delayed eruption, dental hypoplasia and [[Dental caries]] 
- Marfan sign
	- Distention of the epiphyseal plate of the distal tibia with widening and cupping of the metaphysis
	- Gives appearance of a double medial malleolus on inspection and palpation of the ankle
- Delayed walking in infants 
#### Adults
- [[Rachitic & osteomalacic pelvis]] 

### Radiological features of impaired mineralizatioin
- Looser zones/[[Pseudofractures]], MC seen in Superior and inferior pubic ramus 
- Metaphyseal cupping/flaring/fraying/splaying or widening 
- Open fontanelles, occipital flattening, and a more squared appearance
- Spine curvature
- Additional modalities
	- [[Bone Mineral density]]
	- [[Bone scan]]: increased reuptake and can mimic [[bone metastases]]
