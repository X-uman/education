### Introduction


---
### Etiology


---
### Pathogenesis
- The clinical course of lymphatic filariasis includes three phases: 
	- asymptomatic microfilaremia, 
	- episodes of [[Acute adeno-lymphangitis]] (ADL), and 
	- chronic disease (irreversible lymphedema). 
		- Chronic lymphangitis
		- Thickened lymphatic trunk
		- [[Hydrocele]]
		- Chyluria and lymphuria
- Occult
	- [[Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia]]
	- [[Tularial arthritis]]
	- Granulomapathies
	- Endomyocardial fibrosis
	- Granulomas in breast
- Recurrent episodes of ADL may be superimposed upon chronic lymphedema.

### Presentation
- Most individuals are asymptomatic in endemic areas, development of symptoms depends upon cumulative acquisition of worms. Asymptomatic infected individuals have subclinical abnormalities in lymphatic drainage, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. Estimates suggest that about one-third of infected individuals have clinical manifestations
- Filarial fever
- [[Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia]] 
- Chronic
	- [[Lymphedema]]
	-

### Diagnostics
- [[Eosinophilia]] 
- [[Hematuria]] and [[Proteinuria]] 
- PBS: Microfilaria
- Indirect immunofluorescence assay and ELISA to detect antibodies
- Immunochromatography
- PCR
- X-ray: mottled apprearance, calcifications
- Scrotal USG: moving worms
- PFT: [[Restrictive lung disease]]
- DEC provocation: 100 mg produces positive specimens in 30-60 min

### Management
- [[Diethylcarbamazine citrate]]
- [[Ivermectin]] kills only the microfilaria, not adult worms
- [[albendazole]]
- Doxycycline: 200 mg/day for 4 weeks + single dose ivermectin
- Selective Treatment:
	- DEC 6 mg.kg. 12 doses in 2 weeks
	- Ivermectin 150-200 mcg per kg 
- High risk population
	- Albendazole 400 mg + Ivermectin or DEC Single Dose, prevents spread of parasite to mosquito, limited benefit on adult worms.
	- Given annually to high risk population
	- Stop if more than 5 annual rounds with coverage more than 65% of population
- Population strategy
	- DEC Fortified salt 1-4 gm per kg for at least 6-9 months
