### Etiologies
- [[Adrenal Insufficiency]] 
### Pathogenesis
- leads to an increase in the secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland. 
- Stimulation of the adrenal cortex by [[ACTH]] results in adrenal hyperplasia and an increase in the production of adrenal androgens from steroid precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone, thereby causing [[virilization]] in females.
