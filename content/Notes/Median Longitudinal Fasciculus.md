- Highly myelinated 
- Connects Oculomotor, and Abducens nerves to control eye motions
- Frontal eye field supplies contralateral Abducens nerve
- that abducens nerve supplies contralateral Oculomotor by contralateral MLF 
- MLF damaged means:
	- Ipsilateral Oculomotor cannot adduct in conjugated horizontal gaze 
- [[Inter-nuclear Ophthalmoplegia]]:
	- Adducting eye does not cross midline
	- Abducting eye undergoes [[Nystagmus]]
