- Acute attack Asthma ~ [[COPD Exacerbation]] 

### Pathogenesis
- [[Hypersensitivity reaction]] Type 1: Inflammation
- Sensitization in 1st exposure
- Attack on subsequent exposure
- Inflammation: [[Histamine]], [[Acetylcholine]], Bradykinin, Cytokines, [[leukotrienes]] will be released 
- Reversible Brocho-constriction due to hyper-reactive airways

#### Clinical Features
- Episodic presentation
- Triggered by allergen
- Sudden SOB
- Nocturnal/Early morning cough
- Exacerbated by exercise
##### Clinical signs
- Auscultation: 
	- Expiratory [[wheezes]] 
	- Both inspiratory and expiratory in severe
	- Absent breath sounds (Silent lung) if very severe asthma

### Pathology
- Curschmann spirals, and Charcot-Leyden crystals in the sputum

### Asthma phenotypes
| **Phenotype**                           | **Features**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allergic asthma                         | - Most common phenotype <br> - Begins with intermittent symptoms in childhood <br> - Triggered by allergens <br> - Usually associated with atopy (e.g., eczema, rhinitis) <br> - Responds well to ICS-containing treatment |
| Nonallergic asthma                      | - Less common than allergic asthma <br> - Triggered by, e.g., viral upper respiratory tract infections, cold air, GERD <br> - Not associated with atopy <br> - Responds poorly to ICS-containing treatment                 |
| Adult-onset asthma                      | - An uncommon phenotype in which symptoms first manifest in adulthood <br> - Typically nonallergic <br> - Responds poorly to ICS-containing treatment                                                                      |
| Cough variant asthma                    | - Characterized by chronic dry cough without other typical symptoms of asthma (see also “Cough”)                                                                                                                           |

### Diagnosis
- For confirming presence of hypoxia: [[ABG]]
- [[spirometry]] 
	- Expiratory airway limitation: i.e., ↓ FEV1 and ↓ FEV1/FVC ratio 
		- < 0.7 in adults
		- < 0.9 in children
	- Excessive variability in lung function, defined as ≥ 1 of the following:

| **Criteria**                                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ↑ FEV1 of > 12% and > 200 mL after bronchodilator            | - Reversibility of airflow obstruction <br> - Response observed after either bronchodilator responsiveness testing or 4 weeks of ICS-containing therapy                    |
| Excessive variation of FEV1 from one appointment to the next | - Observed in the absence of respiratory infection                                                                                                                         |
| Response during bronchial challenge testing                  | - ↓ FEV1 > 20% from baseline with methacholine challenge test <br> - ↓ FEV1 > 15% from baseline with exercise, hyperventilation, or inhaled mannitol, or hypertonic saline |
| Positive exercise challenge test                             |                                                                                                                                                                            |

- [[Peak flow meter]] for children may help in diagnosis and monitoring 
- [[Allergy work-up]]
### management
- Start with Low dose [[Glucocorticoids]] 
- [[bronchodilators]]
	- Short acting: When attack happens 
	- Long acting: To prevent attacks

### Asthma severity grading
![[Pasted image 20240427190627.png]]

| Severity | Definition (determined retrospectively after several months of treatment)                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Severe   | Uncontrolled asthma despite optimized treatment with high dose ICS-LABA or asthma that requires them to prevent it from being uncontrolled |
| Moderate | Well controlled asthma with Step 3 or Step 4 treatment                                                                                     |
| Mild     | Well controlled with as-needed ICS-formoterol or with low dose ICS + as needed SABA                                                        |


#### GINA Guidelines
- Asthma management cycle: Assess, Adjust and Review

| Step   | Frequency of Attacks           | Controller                             | Reliever            | Alternative controller |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Step 1 | ≤ 2 attacks/week               |                                        | As needed: ICS/SABA |                        |
| Step 2 | > 2 attacks/week but not daily | Low Dose ICS Everyday                  | SABA As needed      | Daily LTRA             |
| Step 3 | Attacks most days of the week  | Low Dose ICS Everyday + LABA Everyday  | SABA As needed      |                        |
| Step 4 | Severe uncontrolled asthma     | Increased ICS Everyday + LABA Everyday | SABA As needed      |                        |

As needed means during attack 
Patient education regarding use of the inhaler device
