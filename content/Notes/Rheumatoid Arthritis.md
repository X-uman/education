| Treatment Type                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Acute Anti-inflammatory Treatment**   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Glucocorticoids                         | - Systemic prednisone: Short-term therapy at lowest effective dose for less than 3 months<br>- Intraarticular injections with triamcinolone acetonide alongside DMARDs for predominant symptoms in ≥ 1 medium or large joint |
| NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors   | Relieve symptoms but do not improve prognosis<br>- Ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib                                                                                                                                          |
| **Long-term Pharmacological Treatment** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Initiation of Treatment                 | - All patients: **Monotherapy** with a conventional [[DMARDS]] <br>- Consider short-term concomitant use of acute anti-inflammatory therapy for symptom control until DMARDs take effect                                     |
| Treat-to-Target Strategy                | - Guided by [[Rheumatoid arthritis Clinical disease activity index]]<br>- Target at 3 months: ≥ 50% improvement in disease activity index<br>- Target at 6 months: Low disease activity (or remission)                       |
|                                         | - Consult rheumatology if targets not reached for treatment adjustment<br>- Prevent discontinuation of all DMARDs in patients achieving disease remission to avoid flare-up                                                  |
