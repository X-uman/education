Schematics showing blood vessel organization and niche microenvironments in long bones during development, homeostasis, and aging. 
During the embryonic development, hypertrophic chondrocytes at the primary ossification center secrete pro-angiogenic factors that stimulate blood vessel invasion, and blood vessels produce angiocrine factors to promote bone formation. 
In the young bone, type H vessels with the columnar organization and arterial connections are found in the metaphysis, and sinusoidal type L vessels are located at the diaphysis. 
Higher magnification insets show cells perivascular to the type H vessels and the interactions of type H vessels and type L vessels with other cell types in the bone. 
BAO = bone-associated osteoclast; BMP = bone morphogenetic protein; FGF = fibroblast-derived growth factor; HIF = hypoxia-inducible factor; HSC = hematopoietic stem cell; IL-33 = interleukin-33; LepR = leptin receptor; OPG = osteoprotegerin; PDGF = platelet-derived growth factor; SCF = stem cell factor; TGF = transforming growth factor; VAO = vessel-associated osteoclast.
