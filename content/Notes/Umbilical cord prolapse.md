### Introduction  
- Umbilical cord prolapse is a rare obstetric emergency.
- It occurs when the umbilical cord descends through the birth canal alongside or in front of the presenting part of the fetus.
- This can happen before or during labor and delivery.
- Umbilical cord prolapse can lead to compression or occlusion of the cord, compromising blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus.
- Immediate medical attention is required to prevent fetal distress or other adverse outcomes.
- Treatment often involves emergency cesarean section.
### Risk factors
- Non-[[Engagement]] 
- Long [[umbilical cord]] 
- Iatrogenic
	- Low [[rupture of membranes]]
	- Manual rotation of head
	- [[External cephalic version]]
	- [[Internal podalic version]] 

### Diagnostics
##### Intrapartum
- Occult prolapse: 
	- umbilical cord is not visibly protruding through the cervix or vagina but is compressed between the presenting part of the fetus and the maternal pelvis during labor
	- abrupt change from a previously normal [[CTG]] to one with fetal bradycardia or recurrent, severe [[decelerations]]. 
	- requires prompt medical attention and intervention
- Cord presentation: Feeling the pulsation of the cord through the  intact membranes
- Overt Cord prolapse
	- Cord is directly palpated by the fingers and its pulsations can be felt if fetus is alive
	- Cord pulsation may cease during uterine contraction
	- DO NOT attempt to pull down or replace the cord: may cause vasospasm 

##### Antepartum
- USG may show cord interposed between presenting part and internal os
- Transvaginal imaging may be necessary

### Management
- Call for help
- Start [[Intrauterine resuscitation]]
- Monitor FHR
- If prolapse is overt
	- Minimize manipulating an overtly prolapsed cord and avoid exposing it to the cold environment
	- Perform emergency delivery by the most rapid and safe route, which is typically cesarean
- 
- Do not attempt to replace the cord
- If immediate vaginal delivery not possible: [[Cesarean Section]] 
- Before emergency C.S.
	- Stop Oxytocin along with the administration of a [[tocolytics]] 
	- IV fluids and Oxygen supplementation
	- [[intrauterine resuscitation]] 
	- Bladder filling done to raise presenting part off the compressed cord (fill 400-79 ml of NS with Foley's catheter), which is emptied before C.S.
	- Lift presenting part off the cord by gloved finger
	- Postural
		- Exaggerated and elevated [[Sims position]]
		- Trendelenburg or Knee-chest position
	- Replace cord into vagina to prevent irritation
- Dead baby: Allow spontaneous delivery

### Anticipation and risk reduction
- Examination following [[rupture of membranes]] in patients with risk factors or with fetal heart decelerations
- Patients with transverse, oblique, or unstable lie should present to the hospital urgently when they begin labor or rupture membranes.
- In high-risk patients, the risk of cord prolapse may be reduced by minimizing use of obstetric interventions that may disengage the presenting part and by performing controlled amniotomy.
- For patients with a funic (cord) presentation that has not resolved before labor at term, management depends on the risk of cord prolapse. see [[Cord presentation]] 

### Minimizing risk during obstretic maneuvers
1. [[Controlled amniotomy]]
2. Avoid disengaging the presenting part
