## before u start
- [[Antepartum hemorrhage]] 
- [[Post-partum hemorrhage]]
- Placenta is broad and deep and ahead of the fetus, along with cord
## how it all started
- [[Threatened abortion]] 
- [[Placenta membranaceae]] 
- [[Multiparity]]: e.g. [[Grand multipara]] 
- [[multiple gestation]] 
- [[Compromised endometrium]] 

## then what?
- Inadequate decidual reaction in LUS: leads to [[Placenta accreta spectrum]]
- When [[lower uterine segment]] starts to expand during later stages [[shear force]] develops between it and placenta, leading to inevitable bleeding mostly maternal
	- Painless bright red (compare [[placental abruption]])

## little further down the rabbit hole 
- [[vasa previa]] 
- placental compression is impaired in Posterior PP, so high risk of ? 
- lack of [[Engagement]] 
- [[Stallworthy's sign]]: [[Fetal head compression]] into pelvis leads to deceleration in posterior type 
- [[Post-partum hemorrhage]]: [[primary hemostasis]] cannot happen, i.e. [[Living ligature]] cannot set in 

## they might confuse u
- PP in early pregnancy, placenta comes up

## what shall u do as a doctor
- [[Placentography]] 
- Do not attempt [[PV examination]] after warning bleeding
- [[Duplex USG]] : To rule out morbidly adherent placenta
- Inconclusive: Double set-up examination

### Management
- Admit all patients 
- [[McAfee-Johnson regimen]] 
- Mode of delivery

| Situation                                               | Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Placenta Previa Detected on Routine Ultrasound**      | - Monitor placental placement.<br>- If placenta previa persists at approximately 32 weeks: Repeat ultrasound at 36 weeks. Schedule cesarean delivery, ideally between 36 and 37 weeks' gestation.<br>- If placenta previa is complicated by placenta accreta: Schedule delivery between 34 and 35 weeks' gestation.                                                                           |
| **Placenta Previa Presenting as Antepartum Hemorrhage** | - Initiate immediate management of antepartum hemorrhage.<br>- If ≥ 37 weeks: immediate delivery.<br>- If < 37 weeks: delivery or expectant management.<br>- In cases of severe, active bleeding or fetal distress: emergency cesarean delivery.<br>- In cases of light or no bleeding and no fetal distress: expectant management.<br>- Consider tocolytics to inhibit uterine contractions. |
| **Route of Delivery**                                   | - For placenta previa: lower segment cesarean delivery.<br>- For low-lying placenta:    <br>  - Lower segment cesarean delivery is usually preferred.   <br>  - Vaginal delivery ± induction of labor may be considered for stable mothers with reassuring fetal status.                                                                                                                      |
