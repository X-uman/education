- MC fetal malposition
- May lead to [[Assisted delivery]] or [[Cesarean Section]]
- At term, before labor and in early labor, studies have reported that 15 to 50 percent of fetuses in cephalic presentation are OP but only 5 percent are OP at vaginal birth because most OP fetuses spontaneously rotate to an anterior position during labor, usually just before or during full cervical dilation, see [[Mechanism of labor]] 

### Diagnosis
- In the second stage, OP (or occiput transverse) position may be suspected if significant [[caput succedaneum]] or [[asynclitism]] is present, or labor is prolonged.
- [[PV examination]] in second stage of labor that identifies the anterior location of the fetal frontal (metopic) and coronal sutures and anterior fontanel
- If there is uncertainty, ultrasound examination can accurately identify fetal head position (studies have reported that ultrasound is a more accurate and objective tool for the assessment of fetal head position)
	- Occiput posterior position is diagnosed when the fetal orbits face toward the transducer held in the transverse position just above the symphysis pubis.
### Management
- **Antepartum, first and early second stage of labor** – Intervention to rotate the fetus is not warranted when OP position is diagnosed antepartum, in the first stage of labor, or in the early second stage of labor as spontaneous rotation to occiput anterior (OA) usually occurs.
- Maternal exercises and repositioning do not increase the rate of spontaneous rotation.
- Prophylactic rotation in the early second stage may lead to [[Umbilical cord prolapse]] or prolapse of small parts if the head is disengaged, without clear benefits. Head engagement does not preclude the possibility of spontaneous rotation.
- As the second stage progresses, fetuses that remain in the OP position may continue to descend at a reasonable rate and deliver spontaneously from the OP position or descent may become protracted or arrested despite adequate uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts.
- For women with prolonged second stage and clinically adequate pelvis for rotation, digital/manual rotation to the OA position rather than expectant management
- perform rotation as soon as descent slows as rotation before an arrest is more likely to be successful than after an arrest has occurred and spontaneous rotation is less likely in this setting.
	- See [[Rotation for OC positions]]
- If rotation is unsuccessful, the patient continues to push and subsequent intervention depends on labor progress and fetal status. 
- If arrest of descent occurs or concern about the fetal heart rate warrants delivery, we attempt operative vaginal birth from the OP position if the leading point of the fetal skull is ≥2 cm beyond the ischial spines, estimated fetal weight is <4000 grams, and there is ample room between the fetal occiput and maternal sacrum/coccyx. 
- If the prerequisites for a safe operative vaginal birth are not met, then cesarean birth is performed.
### Consequences
##### Maternal
- Prolonged first, or second stage of labor or arrest of the second stage 
- Increased incidence of interventions like
	- Artificial [[rupture of membranes]]
	- [[augmentation of labor]]
	- Operative birth 
		- Assisted vaginal delivery is 2 x incidence than OA
		- Cesarean is 3 x incidence of OA
	- [[Perineal injury]]
	- Failed [[Assisted delivery]]
	- Prolonged first or second stage of labor (see [[Prolonged labor]])
##### Fetal
- higher risk of five-minute Apgar score less than 7
- umbilical artery acidemia
- [[Meconium stained liquor]]
- [[Birth injuries]]
- [[Neonatal ICU]] admission 
- Vaginal birth of the OP fetus is associated with a lower rate of shoulder dystocia than other cephalic positions, although there appears to be a higher rate of neonatal brachial plexus injury in the event of a shoulder dystocia
