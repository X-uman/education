### Post-burn hypermetabolism
- A metabolic phenomenon that can be seen in patients with moderate to severe burn injuries.
- Characterized by an initial hypometabolic phase that occurs within 48 hours after injury and a subsequent hypermetabolic state with insulin resistance that develops 5-7 days after injury and can last up to ~ 3 years.
- ubiquitous response to a severe burn injury and can manifest with tachycardia and tachypnea during the hypermetabolic phase 5â€“7 days following the injury
- hypertension (due to hyperdynamic circulation) and hyperthermia are expected findings. T
