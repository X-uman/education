### Introduction
- Epidermoid cysts are also called epidermal inclusion cysts, epidermal cysts, and keratin cysts. The term “sebaceous cyst” is no longer used as it is a misnomer. .
- An epidermoid cyst is an encapsulated lesion containing keratin and lipids and lined with stratified squamous epithelium.

---
### Etiology
- Epidermoid cysts may be primary or may arise from the implantation of the follicular epithelium in the dermis, as a result of trauma, or from a comedo.
---
### Pathogenesis
- Lesions may remain stable or progressively enlarge. 
- The cyst wall consists of normal stratified squamous epithelium derived from the follicular infundibulum.
- Spontaneous inflammation and rupture can occur, with significant involvement of surrounding tissue
The cyst wall consists of stratified squamous epithelium similar to skin surface or infundibulum of hair follicles. 
The cavity is filled with laminated layers of keratinous material. 
In ruptured cysts, a foreign-body inflammatory granulomatous reaction due to the release of the cyst content into the dermis may result in the formation of a keratin granuloma

### Presentation
- Typically occurs in adulthood
- Most common cutaneous cyst
- Dome-shaped, firm, mobile, dermal to subcutaneous nodule or mass
- Typically a solitary lesion found on the face, head, neck, trunk, and/or genitals
- Grows slowly over years or remains stable
- Skin-colored with a central black punctum, erythematous when inflamed
- Does not dimple when pinched
- Typically painless; painful if ruptured, which may subsequently lead to infection
- Cyst contents: thick cream-colored keratinaceous material with an unpleasant odor
- Fluctuation present (Paget's test positive)

### Diagnostics
1. Clinical diagnosis
2. Histology: the cyst wall consists of stratified squamous epithelium similar to skin surface or infundibulum of hair follicles.

### Management
- Stable cyst: Not necessary 
- Inflamed, ruptured cysts: may resolve spontaneously without therapy, although they tend to recur
- Injection of triamcinolone acetonide (3 mg/mL for the face and 10 mg/mL for the trunk) into the inflamed lesion can hasten the resolution of inflammation and may prevent infection and the need for incision and drainage.
- Only small amounts (enough to slightly distend the cyst) should be injected, since injection of larger amounts can result in rupture and scarring.
- If the lesion is fluctuant, incision and drainage is indicated rather than injection.
- it is reasonable to wait until the inflammation has resolved before attempting excision
- Techniques
	- Punch excision technique
	- Minimal incision techniques
- Anesthesia should be injected around the lesion rather than into the lesion in order to avoid rupturing the cyst wall with the pressure of the anesthetic agent.
- The presence of significant surrounding cellulitis or cysts that have not responded to drainage may require oral antibiotic therapy, although in most cases the lesions are sterile.
- However, the drained contents should be sent for culture. 
- Pending culture results, empiric antibiotic therapy can be started with agents active against methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ ([[MRSA]]) in areas of high MRSA prevalence

### Complications
- Infection and abscess formation
- Cock's peculiar tumor
	- When the sebaceous cyst of the scalp ulcerates,
	- excessive granulation tissue forms resembling fungating epithelioma
	- resembles that of squamous cell carcinoma
- Sebaceous horn
- Multiple cysts may be associated with [[Gardner Syndrome]]
- Calcification without punctum: multiple, firm in in scrotum
