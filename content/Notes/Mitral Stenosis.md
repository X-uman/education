### Introduction

### Etiology
 - [[Rheumatic heart disease]] and [[Chronic Inflammation]] 
	 - fibrotic leaflets in addition to commissural fusion and sub-valvular involvement.
	 - calcified valve may also be there
 - [[Infective endocarditis]]
 - [[Atrial myxoma]]
 - [[Prosthetic Valves]] dysfunction
 - [[Carcinoid tumor]]
 - [[Lutembacher syndrome]] 
 - [[SLE]] and [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] 

### Clinical features
- Common in females
- Exacerbated in increased need of [[cardiac output]]
- ==Asymptomatic== till late: Long natural history
- Advanced stage: 

| Proximally                                                                                                                                                              | Distally                                              |

| [[Left Atrial Enlargement]]<br>[[Atrial fibrillation]]<br>[[Pulmonary edema]]<br>[[Pulmonary Hypertension]]<br>[[RV hypertrophy]] <br>[[Right Ventricular failure]]<br> | [[Decreased Cardiac Output]]<br>[[Arterial embolism]] |

### Clinical signs 
- [[Mitral facies]] 
- Pulse: low volume, possible irregularly irregular with [[Apex-Pulse deficit]] if [[Atrial fibrillation]] present
- Apical impulse: Tapping in character
- [[Heart sounds]] 
	- Loud [[S1(heart sounds)]]
	- Opening snap
		- Occurs due to sudden stoppage of stenosed valve when it is opening
		- A shorter interval between S2 and opening snap indicates more severe disease; occurs because left atrial pressure is greater than left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).
	- Rumbling Mid-diastolic murmur heard on left lateral position on expiration with Presystolic accentuation (due to remaining blood in Atrium before Systole)
- See [[Cardiovascular system examination]] 
- Respiratory: Basal crepitation due to [[Pulmonary edema]] 
### Diagnosis
- [[Echocardiography]] to see diameter of valves
- EKG for Fibrillation
- Chest X-ray for Pulmonary edema
- [[Natriuretic peptides]] (Produced by atria and ventricles in response to stress)
### Severity assessment
