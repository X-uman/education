### Vigorous vs non-vigorous neonate
- HR > 100
- Good muscle tone
- Strong respiratory efforts
- [[Neonatal resuscitation flowchart]] 
### Chest compressions
- [[Basic cardiac life support]] 
- If a newborn has severe bradycardia with HR <60 beats min<sup>−1</sup> despite effective ventilation for 30 s, chest compressions are indicated.
- The ideal method of providing chest compressions is to use the two-thumb technique and compress the newborn's chest to **one-third of the anterior–posterior diameter** at the lower third of the sternum.
- Location: Just below the line joining 2 nipples
- Coordinate chest compressions with inflations in a **3:1 ratio** regardless of the presence of an alternate airway.
- 90 chest compression and 30 breaths per min
	- That means: 3 CC + 1 breath in 2 seconds 
- Methods:
	- 2 thumb encircling technique (preferred)
		- More pressure generated, so better perfusion
		- Less fatigue to the team member 
	- 2 finger technique

### Epinephrine
- Dose: **0.01-0.03 mg/kg/dose**, (up to 3 doses can be given
	- 0.1 ml/kg/dose in 1: 10,000 dilution
- Route: IV via Umbilical vein catheter
	- Not able to secure access, then can be given Intratracheally  at a dose of Dose: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/dose
### Fluid maintenance
- Fluid of choice: [[Normal saline]] or O-ve blood
- Calculate hourly rate based on daily fluid requirements
	- Birth to day 1: 40–60 mL/kg/day
	- Day 2: 50–70 mL/kg/day
	- Day 3: 60–80 mL/kg/day
	- Day 4: 60–100 mL/kg/day
	- Days 5–28: 100–140 mL/kg/day
