### Management

### Differential diagnosis 

| Condition                     | Differentiating Features from Down Syndrome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Isolated Hypotonia]]        | Down syndrome typically presents with characteristic physical features in addition to developmental delays. Isolated hypotonia may lack these physical features but still manifest developmental delays and low muscle tone.                                                     |
| [[Zellweger Syndrome]]        | Zellweger syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired [[peroxisome]] function, leading to severe [[Global developmental delay]] , distinctive facial features, and other organ abnormalities not typically seen in Down syndrome.                              |
| [[Congenital Hypothyroidism]] | Congenital hypothyroidism can cause developmental delays similar to Down syndrome, but it is primarily due to thyroid hormone deficiency rather than chromosomal abnormalities. Thyroid function tests can help differentiate between the two conditions.                        |
| Trisomy 13                    | Trisomy 13, also known as Patau syndrome, presents with severe developmental delays, multiple congenital abnormalities, and organ defects different from those seen in Down syndrome. Features may include cleft lip/palate, heart defects, and brain abnormalities.             |
| Trisomy 18                    | Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, shares some similarities with Down syndrome, such as developmental delays and certain physical features. However, Trisomy 18 typically presents with more severe intellectual disabilities and a higher rate of organ abnormalities. |
| [[Williams Syndrome]]         | Williams syndrome is characterized by distinct facial features, cardiovascular abnormalities, hypercalcemia, and a unique cognitive and personality profile, which differ from those seen in Down syndrome.                                                                      |
| Turner Syndrome               | Turner syndrome affects females and is caused by partial or complete absence of the X chromosome. It is characterized by short stature, ovarian insufficiency, and certain physical features distinct from those seen in Down syndrome.                                          |
