### Approach
- History and examination
- [[Ovulation]] assessment 
- [[Ovarian reserve assessment]] to predict ovarian response to [[GnRH agonists]] and subsequent likelihood of achieving a successful pregnancy with assisted reproductive technology.
- Structural assessment
	- USG for screening
	- [[Hysterosalpingography]]
	- Sono-hysterosalpinogography
	- [[Hysteroscopy]] 
	- Falloposcopy
	- Salpingoscopy 
	- [[Laparoscopy]] 
### Management
- [[Ovulation induction]] for anovulation
- Treatment of [[Tubal disorders]]
