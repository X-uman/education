- Globin is protein
- gene responsible for Globin can be mutated, leading to [[Thalassemia]] 
- Beta thalassemia: usually due to point mutations in promoter sequences or splicing sites
	- β-globin locus - short arm of chromosome 11
- Alpha thalassemia: usually due to deletion of at least one out of the four existing alleles
	- The α-globin gene cluster is located on chromosome 16

- Alpha and Beta globin
