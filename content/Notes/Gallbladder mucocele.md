 -[[Notes/Obstruction|Obstruction]]  
	- Impacted gallstone at the gallbladder neck (most common)
	- Resolved acute cholecystitis
	- Tumors at the gallbladder neck or CBD (e.g., GB polyps, cholangiocarcinoma, carcinoma of pancreatic head)
	- Acute inflammatory conditions (e.g., [[Kawasaki disease]]) 
	- Extrinsic compression of the biliary outflow tract (e.g., lymphadenopathy, adhesions, strictures)

## Pathophysiology: 
- chronic biliary outflow obstruction → resorption of bile and secretion of mucin by biliary mucosa → collection of mucinous secretion within the gallbladder with no outflow → gross distension of the gallbladder
