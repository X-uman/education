### Observed in: narrowed small airways
- [[Asthma]]
- Peribronchiolar edema as in [[Left heart failure]] 


Can be polyphonic: many airways
Monophonic: [[lung cancers]] 

[[Airway obstructions]] 

- Rhonchi are seen in medium sized airways obstruction most commonly mucus for e.g. in [[Acute bronchitis]] 
- Chronic rhonchi seen in [[Bronchiectasis]] or [[COPD]] 

Why wheezes are more in expiration?
	- Because during expiration, lungs are squeezed by chest wall to exhale air, at this time, bronchi are also compressed, so they become even more narrower, so sound increases during expiration, and air also cannot properly flow during expiration.
	- Leading to Retention of Air in alveoli 
	- Distending the alveoli with residual Air [[CO2 retention]]
	- [[Prolongation of expiration]] because they cannot throw out air in  that time period
