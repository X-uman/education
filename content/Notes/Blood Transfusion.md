### Blood transfusion in hemorrhage
- The initial hemoglobin and hematocrit may not reflect the degree of acute hemorrhage prior to initial fluid resuscitation. 
- The 2016 ACG LGIB guidelines suggest a target Hb > 9 g/dL, and the 2019 ICG nonvariceal UGIB guidelines suggest a target Hb > 8 g/dL once the patient is stabilized. 
- A higher target Hb (e.g., > 10 g/dL) is suggested for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. 
- Specialist consultation is recommended. 
### Transfusion targets
| Parameter                                    | Target Range                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Hemoglobin                                   | > 7.5 g/dL                    |
| Platelet Count                               | > 50,000/mmÂ³                  |
| Fibrinogen                                   | > 200 mg/dL                   |
| Prothrombin Time (PT)                        | < 1.5 times the control value |
| Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) | < 1.5 times the control value |
