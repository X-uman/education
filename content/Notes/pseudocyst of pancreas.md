  ### Notes
- Complications of acute of chronic pancreatitis 
- [[Space Occupying Lesion]] 
- Lined by [[Granulation tissue]]
- Commonest in body and tail
- Seen in [[Lesser sac]] 
- Forms > 4 weeks of pancreatitis ([[Chronic Inflammation]]) 
- Can form in chronic pancreatitis 

### Subtypes
- Symptomatic
- Asymptomatic
##### D'Egidio classification

| **Type I** Pseudocyst         | **Type II**                                        | **Type III**                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| - After acute pancreatitis    | - After an attack of acute on chronic pancreatitis | - After an attack of chronic pancreatitis   |
| - Normal ductal anatomy       | - Abnormal ductal anatomy without stricture        | - Abnormal ductal anatomy without stricture |
| - No fistula or communication | - 50% chance of fistula                            | - Always communicating                      |
|                               |                                                    | - Appears like retention cyst               |
### Presentation
- [[Mass Effect]] 
	- Spherical swelling with indistinct upper margin, with transmitted pulsation
	- [[Gastric Outlet Obstruction]] 
	- [[Obstructive jaundice]]
	- Duodenal obstruction: Biliary vomiting and [[Malabsorption syndrome]] 
- Rupture: 
	- Hemorrhage and enzyme release into [[Peritoneum]] leading to [[Peritonitis]]
	- Pancreatic-pleural fistula
	- Intraductal Bleeding: [[Hemosuccus Pancreaticus]]
- Infections: [[Abscess]] 
- Internal bleeding: [[hemorrhage]] and shock
- [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] due to release of cyst enzymes into system

### Investigation
- X-ray after NG-tube insertion: bent forward and can be palpated in epigastrium in lateral view 
- [[CECT]] abdomen
- Differentiate from Cystic malignancy by USG guided [[Tissue diagnosis]] 
- [[ERCP]] also allows treatment  
	- ERCP trans-papillary drainage: reserved for pseudocysts that connect with the pancreatic duct 
- Amylase level is high in pseudocyst fluid

### Management
- small, short duration, asymptomatic: no management
- Large cyst (> 5 cm), or symptomatic or lasting > 6 weeks: surgical management
- Internal [[drains]]: The cyst is drained into the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum (i.e., cystogastrostomy, cystoduodenostomy, cystojejunostomy).
	- Cystogastrostomy: Endoscopic or laparoscopic
	- Cystojejunostomy 
	- Cystoduodenostomy 
- External drains if infected 
- Depends upon size of the pseudocyst
- ERCP transpapillary drainage: reserved for pseudocysts that connect with the pancreatic duct

### Complications
- Infection: fever, abdominal pain, sepsis
- Pseudocyst rupture: pancreatic ascites/pancreaticopleural fistula
- Erosion into an abdominal vessel: hemorrhage into the cyst 

### Differential
- [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm]]
- Retroperitoneal cyst
- Cystadenocarcinoma of pancreas (see [[Pancreatic cysts]]) 
- Liver cyst
- mesenteric cyst
- Hydatid cyst
