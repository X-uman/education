### Etiology
-   Radiation
	-   Exudative pericarditis: develops acutely during or after radiation therapy 
	-   Constrictive pericarditis: develops several years after radiation therapy

### Presentation
- Features of [[Right Heart Failure]]
- Features of [[Venous hypertension]] 

##### Clinical signs 
- ==Kussmaul Sign==: Elevated JVP on deep inspiration
- Pericardial Knock in diastole which may present as retractile [[Apical impulse]] which may even be non palpable
- Distant heart sounds
- [[Pulsus paradoxus]]
- Prominent X' and Y descent (Friedrich's sign) in [[Jugular Venous Pressure]], pericardial knock is audible immediately after  deep Y descent

#### Diagnosis
- #initial [[Chest X-ray]] showing **Calcification and fibrosis**
- CT/MRI more accurate, thickness > 2mm
- [[Echocardiography]] to Rule out Abnormal Myocardium/movement
	- ↑ Pericardial thickness 
	- Abnormal ventricular filling with sudden halt during early diastole
	 - Variation in ventricular filling with inspiration
	- Across the tricuspid valve: The velocity of blood flow increases. 
	- Across the mitral valve: The velocity of blood flow decreases. 
	- Moderate biatrial enlargement 
	- Excludes right ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy
- ECG: Low voltage QRS, Atrial fibrillation in severe cases
- Catheterization
	- Equalization of atrial and ventricular pressures
	- Square root sign

### Management
- Pericardiectomy: complete removal of the pericardium
