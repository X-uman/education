### Conservative
| Management Strategies  | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expectant Management   | Applicable for closed injuries with a high likelihood of spontaneous recovery, Observe for 4 months                                           |
| Activity Modification  | Avoidance of activities or sports that may increase the risk of further nerve injury                                                          |
| Splinting              | Prevents joint stiffness and contractures, supports residual nerve functionality, and aids reinnervation                                      |
| Physiotherapy          | Rehabilitation exercises to support nerve regeneration and restore function                                                                   |
| Electrical Stimulation | Supports regeneration of proximal axons and reinnervation of denervated muscles after surgical nerve repair                                   |
| Analgesia              | Nonopioid analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs) and local anesthetic infiltration to manage pain associated with nerve injury                             |
| Drug Therapy           | Treatment of chronic neuropathic pain post-injury (e.g., gabapentin), and enhancement of remyelination and motor regeneration (e.g., lithium) |

### Surgical
- nerve decompression, 
- neurorrhaphy, 
- nerve transplantation, 
- tendon transfer
- Closed fracture:
- Open fracture: Secondary repair after 3 months
- Acute decompression for numbness/parasthesia: Patient is observe for 48 h after fracture reduction and if does not improve, nerve is explored and decompressed
