### Definition
- Clinically significant [[hemorrhage]] like in [[Anemia]] 
- Objectively:
	- 500 ml in vaginal delivery
	- 1000 ml in [[Cesarean Section]] 
	- 1500 ml in Cesarean hysterectomy
### Severity
1. Stage 0: Every patient in labor/giving birth
2. Stage : PPH diagnosed
3. Stage 2: Continued bleeding or vital signs instability and cumulative blood loss < 1500 ml
4. Stage 3: Continued bleeding, with cumulative blood loss >1500 mL or transfusion of >2 units of red blood cells or abnormal vital signs or suspicion of disseminated intravascular coagulation

### Monitoring
- CBC, cross matching, coagulation profile particularly [[Fibrinogen]] levels
- [[Viscoelastic testing]] 
- [[Massive blood transfusion]] protocol 
- In acute PPH, coagulopathy should be suspected in patients with one or more of the following: low fibrinogen level (<300 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia (<100,000/microL), prolonged PT (international normalized ratio INR >1.5), and/or prolonged aPTT (varies by laboratory).
### Causes and management 
- [[Uterine Atony]] 
- [[Retained conceptus]] 
- [[Birth Canal Injuries]] 
- [[Coagulopathy]] 
- Abnormal placentation
	- [[Placenta accreta spectrum]]
	- [[Placenta previa]] 

### Management
###### Early detection
- [[Maternal early warning systems]] 
- [[Shock index]]
- [[Fibrinogen]] level
- [[PPH Flowchart.pdf]] 
- Temporizing measures
	- Bimanual Uterine compression
	- [[Intrauterine hemostasis devices]] 
	- Aortic compression
	- [[REBOA]] 
- Early resort to hysterectomy is appropriate in patients with severe bleeding due to diffuse PAS or a large uterine rupture, which require aggressive surgical management
### Prevention:
- [[Antepartum care]]
- [[Labor]]
