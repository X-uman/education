- [[Vasculitis]] 
- Old name: Henoch Scholein Purpura, Anaphylactoid purpura
- Defective (Poorly o-Galactosylated) [[IgA]] Production which form aggregates and immune complexes followed by perivascular deposition
- This triggers [[Alternate complement pathway]] which causes capillary injury i.e. [[Small vessels vasculitis]] 
- Followed by [[microvascular thrombosis]] 

### Presentation 
- M > F, around 6 years old (< 10 y)
- Up to 90% of cases are preceded by viral or bacterial infection 1–3 weeks prior.
	- Most commonly an upper respiratory tract infection caused by group A Streptococcus
	- GI infections, vaccination, Drugs, food, horse serum
- Vasculitis in different organ systems
	- Palpable purpura in dependent parts of body i.e. ankle, calves
	- Bowel ischemia and infarction: Hematochezia, malena fistula 
	- Hematuria, hemorrhagic pancreatitis, 
	- Respiratory: hemoptysis, 
	- Ocular: red eye, [[CRAO]]
- [[Intussusception]] 
- acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy

### Investigations
- **Platelets, Coagulation panel: Normal** 
- RFT: [[AKI.canvas|AKI]] 
- Low complement levels
- ASO titer high
- **IgA in blood: High** 
- imaging
	- [[Intussusception]] 
	- Testis
	- MRI of brain: Vasculitis in brain 
- Biopsy
	- [[leukocytoclastic vasculitis]] 

### Diagnostics
- lower limb predominance and **without [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]]** or coagulopathy; usually in clusters—along with at least one of the following:
	- Diffuse abdominal pain of acute onset
	- Any biopsy sample showing [[leukocytoclastic vasculitis]], or proliferative glomerulonephritis with predominant IgA deposition in a kidney biopsy sample in patients with atypical distribution of purpura
	- Acute arthritis or acute arthralgia in any joint 
	- Kidney involvement (any hematuria or proteinuria) and IgA deposition
	- [[IgA Nephropathy]] 
 - IgAV has an excellent prognosis in children, usually resolving within one month when not complicated by [[IgA Nephropathy]] . 
 - Adults often manifest with more severe features and have lower remission rates. 
 - All patients require follow-up assessments to rule out the development of chronic renal disease.

### Treatment
- Supportive
	- AKI: 
		- Manage fluids, Electrolytes, acid base
		- Antihypertensive
		- Dialysis 
	- NSAIDS for pain
	- Leg elevation
- Severe vasculitis: Kidney, rectal bleeding, testis, brain, lungs, abdominal pain severe
	- First line: Steroids
	- Second: [[Immunosuppressant drugs]]
- Follow up 
	- BP, RFT, urine analysis
