### Pathology
- Myocardial findings 
- Aschoff bodies 
	- Granuloma of rheumatic inflammation
	- Central area of [[fibrinoid necrosis]]
	- Surrounded by characteristic multinucleated giant cells (Aschoff cells) and other inflammatory cells (mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and T lymphocytes) due to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.
	- Acute rheumatic fever is due to a [[Type II Hypersensitivity reaction]] reaction, but the chronic sequelae of acute rheumatic fever (i.e., rheumatic heart disease) involve a [[Type IV hypersensitivity reaction]] that is responsible for non-caseating granuloma formation.)
- Anitschkow cells
	- Cardiac histiocytes (mononuclear cells) appearing in Aschoff bodies
	- Large and elongated cells 
	- Longitudinal section: ovoid nucleus containing wavy, caterpillar-like bar of chromatin (caterpillar cell)
	- Transverse section: owl-eye appearance  (Not to be confused with the owl-eye appearance of inclusion bodies in cytomegalovirus ([[CMV]]) infection)
### Diagnostics
- [[Revised Jones criteria]] 
- ECHO: Cardiac dilatation, valvular regurgitations (most <br>important prognostic factor) 
- Early cause of death is [[Myocarditis]] usually
### Management
- [[Streptococcus pyogens]] eradication
- Arthritis and fever: [[NSAIDs]], or Steroids
	- if there is no improvement after 2–3 days of treatment, consider other possible diagnoses. 
	- The duration of NSAID treatment is usually 1–4 weeks but can also last as long as 12 weeks.
	- Aspirin 60 mg/kg/day divided into 6 doses
- Cardiac involvement
	- Mild-moderate: [[AChE-inhibitors]] if [[Aortic regurgitation]] and follow up every 2-3 y if mild and annually if moderate
	- Severe: Bed rest, Steroids, Monitor [[Arrhythmias]], Urgent valve replacement in acute [[Mitral regurgitation]] and follow up every 6 months
- [[Sydenham's chorea]]: Steroids, Anti-psychotics 
### Antibiotic prophylaxis
- Inj. Benzathine Penicillin 1.2 MU every 21 days (half dose for <27 kg)
- Or Penicillin V 250 mg BD
- Or Erythromycin 250 mg BD
##### Duration
| Condition                                                | Duration (whichever is longer)             |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Rheumatic fever without carditis                         | 5 years or until the patient reaches 21 y  |
| Rheumatic fever with carditis                            | 10 years or until the patient reaches 21 y |
| Rheumatic fever with carditis and permanent valve defect | 10 years or until the patient reaches 40 y |
