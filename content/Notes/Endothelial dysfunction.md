- Increased Adhesiveness of Endothelium
- Too much Glucose in blood: [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
- High Cholesterol: Goes under endothelial layer and forms [[Atherosis]]
- [[Smoking]] 
- Bacterial toxin: [[Hemolytic uremic syndrome]] 

- [[Virchow's Triad]], leading to [[microvascular thrombosis]] 

- [[Hypertension]]
	- Damaged or activated endothelial cells may produce less nitric oxide and secrete substances that promote coagulation and increase sensitivity to vasopressors
	- Circulating endothelial cell 4x seen in preeclampsia
	- Endothelial microparticles seen in preeclampsia
### Pregnancy
- women with early preeclampsia, have increased vascular reactivity to infused norepinephrine and angiotensin II
