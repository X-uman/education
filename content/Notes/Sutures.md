### Description 
- Natural vs Synthetic

| Parameter                   | Synthetic Sutures                                                                                     | Non-Synthetic (Natural) Sutures                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**              | Man-made materials                                                                                    | Derived from natural sources                                  |
| **Absorbability**           | Both absorbable and non-absorbable options available                                                  | Both absorbable and non-absorbable options available          |
| **Tissue Reaction**         | Generally cause less tissue reaction                                                                  | More antigenic, higher likelihood of tissue reaction          |
| **Monofilament Examples**   | **Nylon** (Non-absorbable), **Prolene** (Non-absorbable), Steel **polydioxanone suture** (Absorbable) | -                                                             |
| **Multifilament Examples**  | **Vicryl** (Absorbable), **Dexon** (Absorbable)                                                       | Silk (Non-absorbable), Catgut (Absorbable)                    |
| **Advantages**              | Consistent quality, less antigenic, customizable properties                                           | Readily available, good handling and knot security            |
| **Disadvantages**           | Can be more expensive, requires synthetic production                                                  | Higher tissue reactivity, potential for disease transmission  |
| **Common Uses**             | Wide range of surgical applications                                                                   | Specific applications where natural properties are beneficial |
| **Absorbable Examples**     | Vicryl, PDS, Dexon                                                                                    | Catgut                                                        |
| **Non-absorbable Examples** | Nylon, Prolene, Polyester (Ethibond)                                                                  | Silk                                                          |
| **Handling and Knotting**   | Generally good, some can be stiffer (e.g., monofilaments)                                             | Generally good, particularly silk (excellent handling)        |


- Natural is more antigenic: [[Foreign body reaction]]
- Absorbable vs Non-absorbable 

| Absorbable      | Non-absorbable                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Skin apposition | Hernia repair, Vascular anastomosis |

- Mono-filament vs

| Mono-filament          | Multifilament                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| More traumatic         |                                      |
| Less chances           | More chances of harboring bacteria   |
| Difficult to make knot | Easier to make a knot, more reliable |
|                        |                                      |
