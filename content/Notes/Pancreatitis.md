### Theories
- Colocalization theory
- Ductal hypertension theory
- Biliary reflux theory
- Autodigestion theory
### Pathogenesis
- Premature activation of Trypsinogen into trypsin inside pancreas, reasons may be
	- Pancreatic duct [[Notes/Obstruction|Obstruction]]
	- Acinar cell injury: Parenchyma
	- gene mutations leading to premature activation of enzyme precursors (PRSS1 mutation)
- Trypsin will digest pancreatic parenchyma and causes cellular [[necrosis]], this triggers acute [[Inflammation]] 
- [[fat necrosis]]  
- [[Liquefactive necrosis]] leads to [[pseudocyst of pancreas]] 
- Next sequalae: [[Inflammation]] 

### Clinical features:
-  [[Notes/Acute Abdomen|Acute Abdomen]] 
	- Very severe Epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting
	- Pain radiating to the back
	- Alleviated on ==leaning forward== or huddled or Muhammadian prayer position
- Associated features
	- Fat necrosis: [[Hypocalcemia]] 
	- [[Notes/Pleural effusion|Pleural effusion]] and [[ARDS]] 
	- [[Ascites]] 
	- [[Hemorrhagic pancreatitis]]: [[features of retroperitoneal bleeding]]

	- Severe pancreatitis: [[parenteral nutrition]] because food in gut in shock causes [[Acute Mesenteric Ischemia]] 

##### Surgical

| Indications for Surgery   | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Generally not indicated   | Surgical intervention is typically not the initial approach and is reserved for specific circumstances.      |
| Pancreatic necrosis       | Surgical debridement and antibiotics may be necessary when the pancreas becomes necrotic.                    |
| Obstruction               | Surgical intervention may be required to remove obstructions causing pancreatitis.                           |
| Gallstones                | ERCP, cholecystectomy, and sphincterotomy are performed, especially if cholangitis develops within 72 hours. |
| Pancreatic head carcinoma | Whipple operation may be indicated for pancreatic head carcinoma.                                            |
| Pseudocyst of pancreas    | Surgical intervention may be needed to address pancreatic pseudocysts.                                       |
| Abscess                   | Incision and drainage may be necessary to manage pancreatic abscesses.                                       |
