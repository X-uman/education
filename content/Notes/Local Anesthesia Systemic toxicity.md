- [[Myocardial depression]] 
	- Cardiac Na channels more slowly unbind bupivacaine than lidocaine 
	- lipid emulsion with the onset of seizures and most certainly at the first signs of cardiotoxicity from Bupivacaine 
	- Vasopressors May be required
	- [[amiodarone]] may be given for Tachycardias 
	- Susceptibility increased during pregnancy 
- signs of cardiac toxicity from bupivacaine
- Low concentration: NO inhibition: [[vasoconstriction]]
- High Concentration: Vasodilation except Cocaine
- Bupivacaine: Ventricular depression, atrioventricular heart block, and life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation
- Features resembling [[Hyponatremia]]
