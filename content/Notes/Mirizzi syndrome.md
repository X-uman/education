- Definition: extrinsic [[Notes/Obstruction|Obstruction]]  of the common bile duct (or any extrahepatic bile duct) by gallstone(s) impacted in the cystic duct or the infundibulum of the [[gallbladder]] 
- Clinical features: similar to [[choledocholithiasis]]


## Imaging findings (preferably [[ERCP]]/[[MRCP]])
- Narrowing of the common hepatic duct
- Stone within the cystic duct
- Dilation of the intrahepatic biliary tree


## Treatment
- ERCP-guided CBD stent placement may be considered preoperatively to allow for biliary drainage. [35]
- Open cholecystectomy may be preferred if diagnosed preoperatively. 


## Complications 
- Cholecystocholedochal fistula: an abnormal communication between the gallbladder and the common bile duct 
- Cholecystoenteric/choledochoenteric fistula ([[biliary-enteric fistula]]): an abnormal communication between the gallbladder or the CBD with the adjacent bowel 
- [[Gallstone ileus]]: due to biliary-enteric fistula
