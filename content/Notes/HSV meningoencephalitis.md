	- T2 FLAIR and DWI shows high signal intensity lesions are seen in the orbitofrontal, anterior, and medial temporal lobes in the majority of patients within 48 h of symptom onset
	- In the immunocompetent adult patient, the pattern is quite typical and manifests as a bilateral asymmetrical involvement of the limbic system, medial temporal lobes, insular cortices and inferolateral frontal lobes. The basal ganglia are typically spared, helping to distinguish it from a middle cerebral artery infarct.
	- restricted diffusion is common due to cytotoxic edema
	- restricted diffusion is less intense compared to infarction
	- beware of T2 shine through due to vasogenic edema
	- Extra-limbic involvement is more prevalent in children than in adults, seen most commonly in the parietal lobe, with sparing of basal ganglia. Eventually, it results in marked cystic encephalomalacia and volume loss in affected areas.
	- HSV has a high affinity for limbic systems with bilateral but asymmetric involvement (temporal lobes involvement is characteristic)

- Perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes, large intranuclear inclusions in neurons and glial cells called "owl's eye" or Cowdry A and Cowdry B(eosinophilic translucent), neuronophagia, microglial nodules, necrosis with foamy macrophages and hemorrhage are characteristics of herpes simplex encephalitis
