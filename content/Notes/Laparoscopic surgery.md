### Principles: I-VITROS 
1. [[Insufflation]] /create space – to allow surgery to take place in the minimal access setting
2. Visualize – the tissues, anatomical landmarks and the environment for the surgery to take place
	- Using light source, telescopes and monitor
3. Identify – the specific structures for surgery
4. Triangulate – surgical tools (such as port placement) to optimize the efficiency of their action, and ergonomics by minimizing overlap and clashing of instruments
5. Retract – and manipulate local tissues to improve access and gain entry into the correct tissue planes
6. Operate – incise, suture, anastomose, fuse
7. Seal/hemostasis

### Instrumentation
- Optical devices
- Instruments for access
- Operative instruments
- [[Energy sources in operating room]]
- [[Controlling hemorrhage]] 

### Advantages
- Shorter hospitalization
- Less pain
- Reduced [[Surgical site infection]] 
- Decreased [[Paralytic ileus]]

### Complications
- [[CO2 embolism]]
- [[Hypercapnia]]
- [[Subcutaneous emphysema]]
- [[Pneumothorax]]
- [[Respiratory acidosis]]
