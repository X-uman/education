### How does it differ from SJS
 - Similar as [[Pemphigus foliaceus]] with sub-corneal separation ([[Vesico-bullous disorders]] ) 
 - SSSS typically spares mucous membranes, affected individuals do not develop photophobia (from conjunctivitis), sore throat (from pharyngitis), or oral or vaginal ulcers.
  - In addition, this condition most commonly occurs in children < 6 years of age, and the onset of blisters is typically preceded by a staphylococcal infection (e.g., impetigo)
