- A prenatal screening test performed at 15–22 weeks' gestation that includes the measurement of β-HCG, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), estriol, and inhibin A in the maternal serum. 
- Decreased levels of free estriol and AFP suggest numerical abnormalities of the fetal chromosomes. 
- β-HCG is also elevated in trisomy 21 and decreased in trisomy 18. 
- In cases with an increased risk (based on maternal age, lab results, and ultrasound), amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling are recommended for chromosome analysis.
