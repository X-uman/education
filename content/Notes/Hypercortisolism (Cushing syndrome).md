### Etiology
- Exogenous glucocorticoids administration
- Overproduction of Cortisol

| Cause                                         | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Adrenal Gland (Primary)**                   |                                                                                                                                                        |
| Adrenal adenoma<br>hyperplasia, and carcinoma |  Pituitary adenoma causing hypercortisolism is called **Cushing disease**                                                                              |
| - [[McCune-Albright syndrome]]                | A genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in the bones, skin, and endocrine glands, including the adrenal glands.                              |
| - PRKARIA and PDE11 Mutations                 | Genetic mutations affecting signaling pathways in the adrenal glands, leading to abnormal hormone production.                                          |
| - Primary pigmented nodular hyperplasia       | A rare condition characterized by multiple small nodules in the adrenal glands, resulting in overproduction of cortisol.                               |
| **ACTH Dependent Production**                 |                                                                                                                                                        |
| - Pituitary gland: [[Pituitary adenoma]]      | Overproduction of ACTH by a pituitary adenoma, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol.                                         |
| - [[Ectopic ACTH production]]                 | Production of ACTH by non-pituitary tumors, such as those in the lungs or pancreas, leading to increased cortisol production.                          |
| - Ectopic CRH production                      | Abnormal production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by tumors outside the pituitary, stimulating ACTH production and cortisol secretion.      |

### Pathophysiology and presentation 
- [[Cortisol]] receptor activation and downstream processes
- Presents as
	- [[Truncal obesity]] 
	- [[Proximal myopathy]] 
	- [[Osteoporosis]], [[Nephrolithiasis]] and [[hypercalcemia]] 
	- Skin fragility
	- [[Fluid overload]] and [[Hypertension]] 
	- [[Hyperandrogenism]]
	- [[Insulin resistance]] 
	- [[Mood disorders]] 
	- [[Cataract]] 
- [[Hyperpigmentation]] if ACTH too high
### Pathology
- Exogenous: B/L Cortical atrophy, normal zona glomerulosa
### Diagnostics
- Cortisol is high in following tests
	- 24 h free cortisol level
	- Late-night salivary cortisol
	- Late-night serum cortisol 
- Loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol production
- [[ACTH]] levels
	- LowÂ (< 5 pg/mL): Suspect ACTH independent
		- Further testing: Adrenal MRI/CT
	- High/normal(> 20 pg/mL): Suspect ACTH dependent 
- To find the cause of ACTH dependent: 
	- Obtain Pituitary MRI to evaluate for pituitary adenoma
	- [[Dexamethasone suppression test]] 
- Investigate for Effects of [[RAAS]] activation 

### Management
- First line: tumor resection
	- Adrenal tumors: [[Adrenalectomy]] 
	- Pituitary tumors: [[Transsphenoidal adenomectomy]] 
- Pharmacological to inhibit Cortisol synthesis
	- [[Ketoconazole]]
	- [[Metyrapone]]
