### Strategies
- [[Permissive hypotension]] until hemorrhage control
- [[Controlling hemorrhage]] 
	- Anticipate and treat [[Trauma-associated coagulopathy]]
	- Limit fluids to avoid [[Dilutional coagulopathy]]
	- Early use of [[Blood products]] over IV fluids and perform [[Balanced resuscitation]] 
	- [[Massive blood transfusion]] 
- [[REBOA]]  
- [[damage control surgery]] to control hemorrhage and reserve physiology

- Try SBP of 70-90 with small boluses of [[Fluids]] while trying to find and control hemorrhage ASAP, i.e. Permissible hypotension 
	- <70 brain ischemia, >90 can cause re bleeding
	- Head injury: SBP >90 
- Severe injury: Blood products 
	- Blood transfusions: 1:1:1 ratio of Packed RBC (O-) , Plasma, Platelets to prevent dilutional coagulopathy aka Balanced resuscitation 
- CRASH II trial: Reduces mortality 
	- Inj. [[Tranexamic acid]] for BP <90, PR >110
	- 1 g IV over 10 min, followed by 1 g over 8 h 
	- All patients suspected with significant hemorrhage
	- SBP < 110 or PR > 110 i.e. Signs of shock 
	- Within 3 h of injury
