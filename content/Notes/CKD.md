### Definition
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as an abnormality of kidney structure or function that persists for > 3 months. 

### Etiology
- [[Diabetic nephropathy]]
- [[Hypertensive nephropathy]]
- [[Glomerulonephritis]]
- Other causes
	- [[Polycystic Kidney disease]]
	- [[Amyloidosis]]
- Idiopathic
### Pathophysiology
- Reduced GFR---> Reduced PO4 Filtration---> Reduced [[Phosphate Excretion]]---> Phosphate Retention([[Hyperphosphatemia]])---> Reaction with [[Calcium]]---> Decreased Free Ionized Calcium in Blood---> Chronic Excessive PTH production---> Secondary [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
- In addition, CKD → ↓ biosynthesis of active vitamin D → ↓ intestinal calcium resorption + ↓ renal calcium reabsorption → [[hypocalcemia]] → [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
- Resultant increase in bone breakdown due to PTH hormone leads to [[Renal Osteodystrophy]]
- Instead of deposition into bone, CaPO4 deposits somewhere else: [[Metastatic calcification]] 
 - ↓ Excretion of phosphate → hyperphosphatemia
	- During the early stages of CKD, plasma phosphate levels will typically be normal due to the increased secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). 
	   - [[FGF23]] is produced by osteoblasts in response to initial hyperphosphatemia and increased calcitriol.
	   - Increased secretion of FGF23 leads to increased phosphate secretion and suppressed conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by inhibiting Hydroxylase enzyme [[Vitamin D metabolism]]
	   - In advanced CKD, the effects of FGF 23 subside (most likely due to development of resistance in target tissues).
- Reduced [[organic acids]] excretion: [[Metabolic acidosis]] 
- [[Notes/Electrolyte imbalance]] 
	- [[Hyperkalemia]] 
	- Sodium and water retention: [[Fluid overload]] 
- Reduced [[erythropoietin]]: [[Anemia]] 
- Reduced [[Gluconeogenesis]]: Hypoglycemia 
- Reduced Nitrogenous wastes excretion: [[Uremia]]
- Reduced Calcium: [[Hypocalcemia]] 
- precipitation of Calcium: [[Calciphylaxis]] 
### Clinical presentation
- [[Uremia]] and related complication
- [[Hyponatremia]]
- [[Hyperkalemia]]
- [[Metabolic acidosis]] 
- [[Anemia]]

### Diagnosis
- Demonstrate One of the following
	- Reduced [[GFR]] < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 
	- Leaky Glomerulus
		- [[Albuminuria]]
		- Hematuria
		- Urine sediments: Waxy cast 
	- tubulointerstitial dysfunction
		- Electrolyte and Acid-base imbalance
		- [[Azotemia]]
		- Reduced Erythropoietin: [[Anemia.canvas|Anemia]] 
		- [[Vitamin D deficiency]]
		- Renin
	- Abnormal kidney
		- Histologically
		- Anatomically
		- [[Kidney transplantation]]
- [[CKD staging]] 
- [[ESRD]]
### Management
- Treat underlying cause if identified
- [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] decreasing preventions
- Treat metabolic complications
- Nutritional management
	- Sodium restriction
	- Potassium restriction
	- Phosphate restriction
- Vaccinations
- Medical management
- [[Renal replacement therapy]] 
- Monitoring
	- ASCVD risk assessment
	- Blood pressure control: ACE-inhibitors
	- Treat [[Hyperlipidemia]]
	- Manage [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
	- [[Antiplatelet agents]] 
- Monitoring for complications
	- CBC every year
	- potassium as needed
	- PTH, Ca, Phosphate every 1-12 months
	- 
### Complications
- Acute
	- [[Fluid overload]]
	- [[Hyperkalemia]]
	- [[immunocompromised status]] 
	- Drug Toxicity
	- [[Complications of Dialysis]]
	- [[Calciphylaxis]] 
- Chronic
	- [[Anemia in CKD]]  (Reduced [[Erythropoietin]]) 
	- CKD-Mineral & bone disorder
	- [[Malnutrition]] 
	- [[Global developmental delay]]
	- [[Failure to thrive]] 
	- [[Metabolic acidosis]]
	- Growth hormone resistance
	- [[Renal Osteodystrophy]]
- In pregnancy
	- Hypertension
	- Proteinuria
	- [[Preterm labor]]
	- [[Cesarean Section]]
	- [[IUGR]]/[[IUFD]] 
	- [[Low birth weight]]
	- Neonatal death
