- Purge [[Functional Residual capacity]] of Nitrogen and replace with Oxygen to get extra time before Anesthesia
- Duration of apnea without desaturation increases if ventilation following anesthetic induction is delayed

- Oxygen insufflation into pharynx can draw it into lungs by negative pressure from Oxygen entering the blood being faster than CO2 leaving the blood
