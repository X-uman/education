### Measurement of JVP
- Keep patient supine with trunk at 45 degree
##### JVP vs Carotid pulse
- JVP is 
	- Non-palpable
	- Readily occludable
	- Located between 2 heads of sternocleidomastoid, lateral to carotid
	- Drops with inspiration, sitting erect
	- Biphasic waveform

- Hepatojugular/abdominojugular reflux 
	- Apply pressure on periumbilical region for 30-60 seconds
	- Normally JVP rises up to 3 cm for < 15 sec while u r pressing
	- If JVP rise persists beyond 1 cm as long as u press on abdomen, then HJR test is positive
	- helpful when [[edema]] is missing
- Left Heart Equivalent is [[PCWP]] 
- [[Kussmaul sign]]: increased JVP on inspiration
- Normal JVP: 6-9 cm which corresponds to 6-8 mm Hg

- A: Atrial contraction
	- [[Tricuspid atresia]] or stenosis: JVP elevated
- X: Atrial  relaxation
- C: Ventricular contraction
- X': Continued atrial relaxation
- V: Isometric Ventricular relaxation and Atrial filling
- Y: Rapid Atrioventricular blood flow
