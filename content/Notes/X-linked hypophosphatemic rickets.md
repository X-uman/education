- Hypophosphatemic rickets that is caused by a hereditary overactivity of fibroblast growth factor 23 ([[FGF23]]). 
- The most common cause (80% of cases) of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is an [[X-linked dominant]] mutation in the PHEX gene, which is responsible for down-regulating FGF23 activity (X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets). 
- Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation that makes FGF23 resistant to proteolysis, or by an autosomal recessive mutation that increases FGF23 production.
