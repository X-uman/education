Buerger's test, also known as the Buerger's angle or the Buerger's test for arterial insufficiency, is a clinical test used to assess the presence of arterial insufficiency in the lower limbs. It is particularly useful in diagnosing peripheral artery disease (PAD). Here's how it is typically performed:

1. **Patient Position**: The patient lies supine (on their back) on an examination table.
   
2. **Elevate the Limb**: The examiner elevates the patient's leg to a 45-degree angle for about 1 to 2 minutes. During this time, the examiner observes the color of the foot. In a healthy individual, the foot should remain pink.

3. **Observe for Pallor**: If the foot becomes pale (pallor), it indicates poor arterial blood supply due to arterial insufficiency.

4. **Lower the Limb**: After observing the pallor, the examiner lowers the leg and has the patient sit up and dangle the leg over the edge of the table.

5. **Observe for Reactive Hyperemia**: The examiner observes the foot for any color changes. In a normal response, the foot will quickly return to its normal color. In cases of arterial insufficiency, the foot may initially appear cyanotic (bluish) and then exhibit reactive hyperemia (a bright red flush), which indicates delayed and insufficient blood flow.

### Interpretation

- **Normal Result**: The foot remains pink during elevation and quickly returns to normal color when lowered.
- **Abnormal Result**: The foot becomes pale during elevation and exhibits delayed return to normal color, possibly with cyanosis followed by reactive hyperemia when lowered.

Buerger's test is named after Leo Buerger, who described thromboangiitis obliterans, a disease that involves inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) in small and medium-sized arteries and veins of the extremities.

This test is a useful, non-invasive clinical tool to assess arterial blood flow and can help in the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease and other conditions affecting the arteries.
