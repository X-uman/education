### Characteristics
- Synonyms: ascorbic acid
- Sources: fruits and vegetables
### Functions
- Antioxidant
- Promotes intestinal iron resorption
	- As **c**helating agent: increases iron solubility through chelate complex formation
	- As redox partner: reduces poorly soluble Fe3+into highly soluble Fe2+
	- Transfer of Iron from Transferrin to Ferritin
- Formation of Tetrahydrofolate 
- Coenzyme for important enzymatic reactions
	- **C**ollagen synthesis: hydroxylation of proline and lysine
	- Noradrenaline synthesis: required for dopamine β-hydroxylase (hydroxylation of dopamine to noradrenaline)
	- **C**holesterol metabolism ([[Cholesterol metabolism]] to Steroids and Bile salts)
	- Synthesis of **C**arnitine
- Vitamin C: Collagen, Carnitine, Cholesterol, Dopamine, Folate, Ferrium, Copper, Anti-oxidant 
- Think of vitamin C as “absorbic acid” since it promotes the intestinal absorption of iron.
### RDA and Sources: 
- An adequate intake is 40 mg for ages 0-6 mo and 50 mg for 6-12 mo. 
- For older children the recommended dietary allowance is 15 mg for ages 1-3 yr, 25 mg for 4-8 yr, 45 mg for 9-13 yr,
- and 65-75 mg for 14-18 yr. 
- The recommended dietary allowances during pregnancy and lactation are 85 mg/day and 120 mg/day, respectively. The requirement for vitamin C is increased during infectious and diarrheal diseases.
- Children exposed to smoking or environmental tobacco smoke also require increased amounts of foods rich in vitamin C.
- Sources:
	- Citrus fruits
	- Berries
	- Melons
- [[Vitamin C deficiency]] 
### Vitamin C toxicity
- Clinical features
	- Nausea, vomiting
	- Diarrhea, bloating
	- Fatigue
	- ↑ Risk of [[Iron Overload]] in transfusion patients and hereditary hemochromatosis due to increased absorption of dietary iron, Thalassemia also
	- [[Nephrolithiasis]] due to ↑ [[calcium oxalate]] formation
### Therapeutic use
- Supportive treatment for [[methemoglobinemia]]: Vitamin C reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+

- [[Menke's disease]]: Copper cannot go where it is needed
