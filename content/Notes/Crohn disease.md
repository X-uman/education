### Introduction
- Bimodal distribution
- HLA-B24 Association
- The concordance rates for monozygotic twins for developing Crohn disease and UC are 50% and 15% respectively. For dizygotic twins, the concordance rate for both forms of IBD is less than 10%
- [[Interleukin-23]]-[[T-helper cells]] Th17 dysfunction 
- [[NOD2 Gene]], [[ATG16L1 Gene]], [[IGRM Gene]] Mutation (**components of autophagy pathways** and are involved in recognition of and response to intracellular bacteria.)
- Smoking associated 
- [[Wall-itis]]
- Unlike ulcerative colitis, CD is not limited to the colon but can manifest anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract.
- White female middle aged like [[Multiple Sclerosis]] 

### gross
- Small Intestine–40%, SI + Colon–30%, Remainder in Colon Anorectal region–10-50%. Terminal Ileum–70-80%, with caecum
- Multiple, Separate Sharply delineated(Deep, knife-like) areas of Disease––>[[Skip Ulcers]] (Differentiates from UC)––> Patchy focal Distribution
- Earliest Lesions––> [[Aphthous Ulcers]]––>  Coalesce into elongated Serpentine Ulcers––> Longitudinally Oriented
- Transmural Inflammation, Edema––> Rubbery Appearance
- Submucosal Fibrosis and Hypertrophy of Muscularis Propria––> [[Strictures]] Formation––> Hose Pipe Appearance––> “[[String Sign]]”, a thin stream of Barium passing through the diseased segment.
- Serosa––>Granular Dull-grey, Mesenteric Fat surrounding the Serosa––> Creeping Fat as a protective response to inflammmation? 
- Unaffected area––> Cobblestone Appearance/pseudopolyps––> Diseased Tissue Depressed below the level of Normal Mucosa––>
- Fissures Formation––> Bowel Adhesions, may progress into Fistulation, Sinus Tract formation, Perforation and  Local Abscesses

### micro
- [[Chronic Inflammation]]––> [[Lymphocytes]], [[Plasma Cells]], Histiocytes
	- Non-Caseating [[Granuloma]]––> Submucosa or any layer or Mesenteric LN––> epithelioid cells, Langhan's or foreign body type of giant cells and vaguely limited by lymphocytes.  Presence of central hyaline area but no caseation. (50-60% pts). But not seen in all CD patients(35%)
	- **Non-caseating epithelioid granulomas** are one of the **diagnostic hallmarks** of **Crohn disease**. They are found in **40-60% of cases**; therefore, **absence of granulomas does not exclude Crohn disease**. 
	- Cutaneous Granulomas––>Metastatic Crohn Disease(misnomer)
- Crypts––> Filled with [[Neutrophils]]––> Crypt Abscesses––> Destruction of Crypts(––> Mucosal Atrophy) and Ulceration––> Superficial or Deep  
- Repeated destruction and Regeneration––> Distortion of Mucosal Architecture––> Branching and unusual Orientation
- Epithelium––> Antral, pseudo-pyloric Metaplasia, Paneth Cell Metaplasia in Left Colon
- Submucosa––> Edema and Dilated Lymphatics––> Fibrosis––> Strictures
- Sub-serosal Lymphoid aggregation
- Cytoplasmic Mucins preserved

- Like [[Hidradenitis Suppurativa]] of GIT 
### Presentation
- Whites >> Blacks, Jews >> Caucasians, F > M, 20-40 and 60-80 yo Rare in Asia and Africa, Smoking strongly associated
- Mostly––Intermittent Attacks of Mild Diarrhea, Fever, Abd Pain
- 20%––Rt. Lower Quadrant Pain, Fever, [[Bloody diarrhea]] mimicking [[Acute Appendicitis]] or [[Bowel Perforation]]
- Gross blood not frequent but [[Occult Blood Test]] is often positive 
- Asymptomatic Periods of Weeks to months––> Reactivation can be triggered by Physical, emotional, dietary, smoking
- Similar features to [[Granulomatous diseases]] 
- CD usually spares the rectum unlike UC 

### Complications
- [[Malabsorption syndrome]] 
- [[Notes/Strictures|Strictures]] 
- [[Sinuses and Fistulae]] in 
	- [[Urinary Bladder]] leading to Recurrent [[Notes/UTI|UTI]] 
	- Vagina
	- Abdominal
	- Perianal Skin
- [[anal fissures]] and Abscess formation
- [[Bowel Perforation]] and [[Peritoneal Abscesses]]
==- [[IBD extra-intestinal manifestations]]== 
- [[toxic megacolon]]––> Due to destruction of [[Myenteric Plexus]](more common in UC)            
- Intestinal Carcinoma––>4-5x especially in [[Pancolitis]] (Field Cancerization?) 

### Diagnosis
- Symptoms =/= disease activity accurately
- Biomarkers
	- [[Fecal Calprotectin]] and/or [[Fecal lactoferrin]] 
	- [[Inflammatory markers]] 
	- Anti-[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] Ab (ASCA) more commonly elevated in CD > UC ([[pANCA]] more in UC)
	- Evaluate [[Macronutrients]] and [[micronutrients]] deficiency
	- Evaluate End organ damage
- Endoscopy
- Imaging

### Differential diagnoses
- Acute [[appendicitis]]
- Infectious gastroenteritis/colitis
- [[Noninfectious colitis]] 
- [[Diverticulitis]]
- [[Irritable bowel syndrome]]
- [[Gastrointestinal Tuberculosis]]
- Malignant intestinal transformations

### Management
- Induction
	- [[Glucocorticoids]]
		- Controlled ileal release budesonide
		- Oral Prednisolone
		- Oral Methylprednisolone
	- [[Biological Agents]] 
		- are used to both induction and 
		- maintenance of moderate to severe disease refractory to immunosuppresants 
	- [[Sulfasalazine]] for mild to moderate Colonic or Ileocolonic CD, not effective in isolated Small Bowel disease
- Maintenance
	- [[Immunosuppressant drugs]] 
- Closing [[Sinuses and Fistulae]]: [[Infliximab]]

### Prognosis
- CD is a chronic disease that is currently not curable. Patients with any of the following features are at high risk of progression to severe disease and may require more aggressive treatment to prevent complications of CD.
    - Young age at diagnosis (< 30 years of age)
    - Early need for steroid use
    - Small bowel involvement
    - Perianal or rectal disease
    - Previous stenosis, fistula, and/or abscess
    - Visceral adiposity
