- CVD is classified using the CEAP classification system.
    1. C: clinical signs, ranked in severity from C0â€“C6
    2. E: etiology; may be congenital (Ec), primary (Ep), or secondary (Es), or ranked as unidentified (En)
	1. A: anatomy; involves the superficial veins (As), perforators (Ap), or deep veins (Ad), or is ranked as unidentified (An)
	1. P: pathophysiology; caused by reflux (Pr), obstruction (Po), or both (Pr,o), or is ranked as unidentified (Pn)
- The clinical component of CEAP is often used alone in primary care as it does not require venous studies.
