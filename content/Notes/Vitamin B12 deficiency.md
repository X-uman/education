### Clinical presentation
- [[Megaloblastic anemia]]
---
- [[Demyelination]] 
	- [[Subacute Combined degeneration of Spinal cord]] 
	- [[Peripheral neuropathy]] 
	- dementia, and even frank psychosis like [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]] 
- Neuro-psyhiatric
	- Reversible [[Dementia]]
	- Depression
	- Paranoia
- [[Blurring of vision]] due to [[Optic atrophy]] 
---
- Glossitis and beefy red tongue
### Diagnostics
- Features suggestive of [[Megaloblastic anemia]] 
- Evaluate for [[pernicious anemia]] 
- [[Endoscopy]] to assess [[Atrophic gastritis]] 
- D-xylose absorption test for [[Malabsorption syndrome]] 
- If Vitamin B12 levels are normal
	- Measure Homocysteine (increased both in B12 and Folate deficiency)
	- Methyl malonic acid: normal in Folate deficiency 
- MRI:
	- [[Subacute Combined degeneration of Spinal cord]] 
	- [[Optic atrophy]] 
- Although total serum B12 levels are usually sufficient for the diagnosis, it should be noted that this assay does not distinguish between active circulating B12 (containing reduced monovalent cobalt - Co+) and the inactive form (containing oxidised divalent cobalt - Co++). This is important in some clinical settings such as nitrous oxide abuse
### Management
- [[Vitamin B12 supplementation]] 
- Treat underlying cause
- Treat secondary folate deficiency
- If cause not found: lifelong supplementation
### Differential diagnoses
- [[Vitamin B1(thiamine)]] deficiency
- [[Folic acid (B9)]] deficiency: does not have features of [[Demyelination]] 
- Causes of [[Macrocytic anemia]] 
- Other causes of [[Peripheral neuropathy]]
- Other causes of [[Demyelination]]
