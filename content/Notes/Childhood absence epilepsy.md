### Introduction


### Presentation
- More common in females
- Age: 6-7 y 
- Caregivers complaints: Daydreaming and decreased attention in class, deteriorating performance
- No pre-ictal or post-ictal phases except amnesia about the event
- Duration 5-10 seconds up to 100 times / day
- Amnesia about the seizure
- Subtle automatism as in [[Focal onset seizures]] with altered consciousness: Lip smacking, eye fluttering or head nodding are common
- Atypical absence seizure: 
	- More gradual onset and ending
	- more responsive
	- and duration > 30 sec
	- [[Automatism]] 
	- Small hand movements can be seen
- Triggers: [[Hyperventilation]], lights

### Diagnostics
- 3 Hz spikes and waves in all regions of the brain

### Management
- DOC: [[Ethosuximide]]
- 2nd line: [[Sodium Valproate]] but it increases risk of inattention in children [[ADHD]] 
- 3rd line: [[Lamotrigine]] 
- In atypical absence epilepsy: Valproate preferred 

### Prognosis
- 80% of children are seizure-free with treatment
- Usually subsides before adulthood
