### Introduction
- Severely Reduced vWF: Increased degradation of Factor 8, so factor 8 deficiency and impaired intrinsic pathway 
- increased [[Partial thromboplastin time]]: [[secondary hemostasis]] affected in severe cases (Type III) (aka Factor VIII-related antigenic protein deficiency)
- Broken down by protease [[ADAM-TS13]], deficiency of which causes [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura]] which can be considered a polar opposite of vWD

## Types:
- Type 1: Partial Quantitative (Give [[Desmopressin]]) AD
- Type 2: Qualitative vWD (Give rVWF and VIII) AD
	- [[Classification-of-von-Willebrand-disease.png]]
- Type 3: Completely absent (Give rvWF and VIII) AR
- Acquired deficiency
	- Lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases
		- [[Multiple myeloma]]
		- [[Monoclonal gammopathies]]
		- [[Lymphomas]]
		- [[essential thrombocythemia]]
	- [[SLE]]
	- [[Ventricular Septal defect]], [[Aortic Stenosis]]
	- [[Hypothyroidism]]
	- [[Sodium Valproate]] 

### Diagnostics
- Normal platelets count and normal morphology
	- [[Bernard-Soulier syndrome]]: Giant platelets
- Increased [[Bleeding time]] 
- PTT: increased in due to factor 8 degradation in severe cases
	- Factor 8 levels decreased
- Definitive:
	- vWF assay, Factor VIII levels
	- [[Ristocetin cofactor assay]]: No change or level < 30 IU/dL


### Treatment vWD
- [[Desmopressin]] for mild to moderate cases
- vWF + Factor VIII concentrate for severe bleeding and as prophylaxis, and if desmopressin ineffective
- [[OCPs]] for [[Menorrhagia]]
- [[Antiplatelet agents]] are contraindicated
- acquired vWD: Treat underlying cause due to antibodies: IVIG 
### Association
- [[Angiodysplasia]]
### Differential diagnoses 
- How to differentiate from [[Glanzmann thrombasthenia]] ?
- [[Bernard-Soulier syndrome]] shows abnormally big platelets like [[Immune thrombocytopenia purpura]], Unaffected PTT
### related
- [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura]]
