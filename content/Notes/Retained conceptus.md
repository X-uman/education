### Etiology
- [[Placenta accreta spectrum]] 
### Clinical spectrum
- [[Retained placenta]]: When Placenta not delivered even after 15-30 min of birth of baby 
	- Separated but retained
	- Simple adherent
	- [[Placenta accreta spectrum]] 
	- Incarcerated placenta due to hour glass contraction if [[Ergometrine]] is given which causes LUS contraction also (Give [[Halothane]]) 
### Diagnostics
- Retained placental tissue can be identified visually and by palpation at a cesarean birth or by palpation after a vaginal birth.
- In cases of delayed (secondary) hemorrhage, retained placental tissue is usually detected by ultrasound and removed by curettage.
### Management
- [[Dilation and evacuation]] under [[General Anesthetics]] for Placenta accreta
- Exploration and removal under GA for [[Placenta succenturiata]] 
- [[Hysteroscopy]] and removal with [[Ovum forceps]] 
- [[Uterotonics]]
- [[Placenta accreta spectrum]] (PAS) generally requires hysterectomy, but uterine conservation with placental resection may be successful without excessive risk in selected cases of focal accreta or a posterior or fundal accreta.
