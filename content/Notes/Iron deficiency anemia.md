### Pathophysiology
- Reduced iron intake
- Reduced [[Iron Absorption]] 
- Loss of Iron: Chronic GI Bleed: Loss of Iron from the body i.e. cannot recycle iron
	- [[Menstruation]] 
	- Chronic/occult [[GI Bleeding]]: [[Occult Blood Test]] for feces 
	- [[hemorrhage]]  
- [[Iron]]
- Iron deficiency anemia in men > 50 years and postmenopausal women should raise suspicion for colorectal cancer.

### Diagnosis
- RBC indices 
- Serum Iron: Decreased
- Serum Ferritin: Decreased
- Transferrin Saturation (Normal 1/3 or 30%): Decreased
- Total Iron Binding Capacity: Increased
- Transferrin receptors
- Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin: Increased (normal in [[Thalassemia]])

### Management 
- [[Hematinics]] 
- Treatment of underlying causes
