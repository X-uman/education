### Pathogenesis
- Autosomal recessive 
- [[Trinucleotide repeat expansion]] of GAA of FXN gene on [[Chromosome 9]]
- Deficiency of Frataxin
- [[Fenton reaction]] due to deficiency of Frataxin, an iron-binding protein
- Insufficient energy production in [[mitochondria]] (Frataxin is involved in the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are used in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.)
	- Degeneration of CNS and PNS Axons
	- Cerebellum 
	- Pancreatic islet
	- [[Hemochromatosis]] 


### Presentation
- Present in childhood around 8-15 y, if >25 y then, considered late onset
- Deposition of iron in heart: [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]
- In Pancreatic islets: DM associated with Insulin resistance and deficiency 
- Spinal cord: similar pattern as [[Subacute Combined degeneration of Spinal cord]] but not spinal lesions are not seen in [[Hemochromatosis]] 
	- Spinocerebellar tract
	- Lateral Corticospinal tract: [[UMN Lesions]] 
	- Dorsal Column: Loss of Proprioception, vibration senses 
	- Cerebellum: [[Cerebellar signs]] 
- PNS: [[LMN Lesions]] 
	- Dorsal root ganglion: Loss of deep tendon reflexes 
	- [[Peripheral neuropathy]]: high step gait
	- Bladder dysfunction
	- Hearing loss

 
### DDx
- Other diagnoses include Charcot-Marie-Tooth types 1 and 2, 
- ataxia with [[vitamin E ]]deficiency, 
- ataxia-oculomotor apraxia types 1 and 2, and other 
- early-onset ataxias
- myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF)
- [[ataxia telangiectasia]] 
- [[tuberous sclerosis]] 

### Diagnostics
- A specific trinucleotide repeat expansion assay should be performed in all suspected cases.
- ECG: T-wave inversion and ventricular hypertrophy
- Echocardiography: symmetric, concentric ventricular hypertrophy
- Nerve conduction studies
   - Sensory: absent or reduced sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP)
   - Motor: normal until advanced stages
- MRI brain and spinal cord: cervical spine atrophy (minimal cerebellar atrophy)

### Treatment
- No available cure
- Treat symptomatically


## Prognosis
- MCC of Death: [[Heart failure]] due to Cardiomyopathy
- Average Age of death: 37 y
