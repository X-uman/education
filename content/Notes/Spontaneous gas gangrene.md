### Pathogenesis
- Generally occurs via hematogenous seeding of muscle with bacteria, commonly Clostridium septicum, from a gastrointestinal tract portal of entry.
- Gastrointestinal lesions are often known or undiagnosed adenocarcinoma of the colon.
- Risk Factors for Spontaneous Gas Gangrene:
    - Congenital or cyclic [[Neutropenia]].
    - [[Post radiation therapy]] to the abdomen.
- Diagnosis Challenges:
    - Diagnosis of spontaneous gas gangrene is frequently missed or delayed due to lack of consideration.
- Transmission via Contaminated Allografts:
    - C. septicum has been transmitted from contaminated musculoskeletal allografts harvested from cadaveric tissues.
- C. tertium Involvement:
    - Associated with spontaneous myonecrosis.
    - Can grow aerobically, potentially mistaken for contaminants like diphtheroids or Bacillus species.
    - Resistance to penicillin, cephalosporins, and clindamycin may facilitate survival in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Pathogenesis
- _C. septicum_ can grow in normal tissues; it does not require anaerobic conditions. The presence of a gastrointestinal lesion facilitates entry of the organism into the bloodstream and then into other tissues
	- [[Diverticulitis]] 
	- GI surgery
	- IBD
	- Colonic malignancy
	- [[immunocompromised status]] 

### Presentation
- abrupt onset of severe muscle pain
- confusion or malaise
- edema and bullae filled with clear, cloudy, hemorrhagic, or purplish fluid
- The skin around the bullae has a purple hue, perhaps reflecting vascular compromise resulting from bacterial toxins diffusing into surrounding tissues
- Histopathology of muscle and connective tissues demonstrates cell lysis and gas formation; inflammatory cells are absent

### Diagnostics
- Fever and severe pain in an extremity (in the absence of trauma) should raise suspicion for spontaneous gas gangrene.
- Gas in tissue favors clostridial infection
- Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of  large gram-variable rods at the site of injury
	- Gram stain of bullous fluid may be particularly useful
	- Blood cultures should also be obtained since bacteremia in _C. septicum_ gangrene usually precedes cutaneous manifestations by several hours
