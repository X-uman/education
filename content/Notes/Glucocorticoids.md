### Class 
- 

### Mechanism
- As effective antipyretics, glucocorticoids act at two levels. First, similar to the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, glucocorticoids reduce PGE2 synthesis by inhibiting the activity of [[phospholipase A2]], which is needed to release arachidonic acid from the cell membrane. 
- Second, glucocorticoids block the transcription of the mRNA for the pyrogenic cytokines
- in meningitis, work by inhibiting the synthesis of IL-1β and TNF-α at the level of mRNA, decreasing CSF outflow resistance, and stabilizing the blood-brain barrier
