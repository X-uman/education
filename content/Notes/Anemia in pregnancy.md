### Definition
 - Diagnostic Hb levels for anemia during pregnancy
    - First trimester: Hb < 11 g/dL (< 33% Hct)
    - Second trimester: Hb < 10.5 g/dL, <32 percent
    - Third trimester: Hb < 11 g/dL


An MCV <80 fL in the absence of iron deficiency suggests thalassemia; further testing with hemoglobin electrophoresis is indicated.
