Keywords:
	- CPP, Positively birefringent, Chondrocalcinosis 
#### Pathogenesis
- [[Calcium Pyro-phosphate]]  crystal deposition in joints
- Crystal phagocytosis by macrophages
- Recruitment of neutrophils which damage joint
- Chronic pseudogout #associated with Macrophages and fibrosis
 - Small percentage #associated with following in <50 y patients
	- Primary [[Hyperparathyroidism]]
	- [[Hemochromatosis]]
	- [[Hypophosphatemia]]
	- [[Hypomagnesemia]]
	- Chronic [[Gout]]
	- Post-meniscectomy
	- Gitelman' syndrome
	- [[Epiphyseal dysplasias]]

| Acute attack (commonest: Knee)   | Acute Gout (pseudogout has longer duration of attacks and systemic features also) |
| Symmetric synovitis              | Rheumatoid arthritis                                                              |
| Restriction of spine mobility    | Ankylosing spondylitis (due [[Intervertebral disc]] and ligament calcification)   |
| Spinal stenosis                  | -                                                                                 |
| Rarely, Nodules resembling tophi | Gout                                                                              |
| Chronically                      | Osteoarthritis                                                                    |

#### Investigations
- [[arthrocentesis]] #microscopy shows rectangular, rhomboid, Positive Birefringent crystals![[Pasted image 20240223165022.png]]
- Radiograph: 
	- Linear radio-dense deposits in joint menisci or articular cartilage (==Chondrocalcinosis==) 
	- Subchondral cysts 
	![[Pasted image 20240223165446.png]]
- Evidence for familiar aggregation
- Serum [[Calcium]], [[Iron]], Transferrin
- Radiology resembling [[Neuropathic arthritis]] 

### Treatment
- Anti-inflammatory drugs for both acute and chronic cases. 
 - Prophylaxis: Consider low-dose colchicine to decrease the frequency of acute attacks.
