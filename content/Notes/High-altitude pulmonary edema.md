---
- Non-cardiogenic PE occurring after rapid ascent typically to > 4500 m
- MC cause of death 

#### Pathophysiology
- [[Hypoxia]] leads to increased [[Pulmonary vascular resistance]]
- Precipitation of [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
- Hydrostatic pressure and inflammatory response causes accumulation of ECF and proteins in Alveolar spaces: [[Pulmonary edema]]

### Presentation
- Onset: typically 2-4 d after arrival
- [[Hypoxemia]]
- [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
- [[Pulmonary edema]]

### Investigations
- CXR: Patchy infiltrates
- ECHO: increased pulmonary pressure, normal LV pressure

### Treatment
- Rapid descent
- [[Oxygen therapy]]
- [[Nifedipine]] OR [[PDE-5 Inhibitors]]
