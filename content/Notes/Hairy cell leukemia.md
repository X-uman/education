- Epidemiology
	- Most common in middle-aged men
	- ♂ > ♀ (4:1)
- Pathology: mature B-cell tumor; [[BRAF]] mutations are common
- Clinical features
	- Symptomatic pancytopenia
	- [[Massive splenomegaly]] 
	- No lymphadenopathy
	- B symptoms are rare.
- Diagnostics
	- Usually tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain positive
	- Flow cytometry (preferred over TRAP stain): CD11c marker
	- CBC: Leucopenia is common but up to 20% of patients have leukocytosis.
	- Peripheral blood smear: Hairy cells have irregular cytoplasmic projections that cause the characteristic “hairy” appearance. 
	- Bone marrow aspiration: often yields a dry tap due to bone marrow involvement with subsequent fibrosis
