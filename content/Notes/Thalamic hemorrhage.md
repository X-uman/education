### Presentation
The combination of hemiparesis, hemisensory deficits, miotic and nonreactive pupils, and gaze deviation downward and toward the affected side of the body (i.e., away from the side of the brain lesion) is a phenomenon known as “wrong way eyes” and characteristically occurs in thalamic hemorrhage. 
In contrast, other sites of supratentorial hemorrhage typically cause a gaze deviation toward the side of the lesion (i.e., away from the affected side of the body). This patient’s left-sided weakness and sensory loss, miotic nonreactive pupils, and leftward and downward deviation of her eyes are best explained by a stroke in the right thalamus.

Note that the thalamus is a relatively large region of the brain and thalamic stroke has a variety of manifestations (e.g., pure sensory stroke in lacunar syndromes). However, “wrong way eyes” is a classical finding of thalamic hemorrhage.
