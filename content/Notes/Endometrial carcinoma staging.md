- Stage I–Tumor confined to Uterus: [[Notes/Abnormal uterine bleeding]]
- Stage II–Tumor involving Uterus and Cervix: [[Chronic pelvic pain]] and Palpable mass 
- Stage III–Tumor confined within the True Pelvis
- Stage IV–Tumor extended beyond true pelvis or involved Rectum or UB

| Postmenopausal patients and patients who do not wish to preserve fertility | - First-line: Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy <br> - Laparoscopy preferred <br> - Assessment of lymph nodes recommended (e.g., sentinel lymph node biopsy, removal of suspicious nodes, or complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy) <br> - Peritoneal washings may be performed <br> - Alternative: Hysterectomy with ovarian preservation (select patients only) <br> - Adjuvant treatment not normally required, but radiotherapy should be considered for high-risk patients                               |
| Patients wishing to preserve fertility                                     | - Uterine preservation possible for women who wish to carry a pregnancy in the future i.e., in those with grade 1, well-differentiated disease, that is limited to the endometrium after shared decision making<br> - Usually consists of [[Progestin therapy]] <br> - Definitive surgical therapy recommended after childbearing <br> - Hysterectomy with ovarian preservation for patients willing to use a surrogate <br> - Treatment with progestins may be considered for patients not suitable for surgery due to medical comorbidities |
| **Lymph node involvement or locally advanced disease**                     | - Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy PLUS adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy <br> - Chemotherapy: usually paclitaxel and carboplatin <br> - Radiotherapy: brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy depending on disease extent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Metastatic disease**                                                     | - Palliative therapy focused on symptom control <br> - May include surgical tumor reduction and/or medical therapy (palliative chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
