### Mechanism
- Induce Osteoclast [[Apoptosis]] 
- Bisphosphonates also reduce bone formation since bone resorption and formation are intrinsically connected. However, bone resorption is reduced more severely than bone formation.
	- Nitrogen containing BP: Inhibits enzyme Farnesyl PP Synthase -> Disturbs Osteoclast metabolism and signaling 
 - Inhibit mineralization (structurally similar to pyrophosphate, a natural inhibitor of bone mineralization) but PP cannot enter bone tissue physiologically 
### Indications
- [[Osteoporosis]]
- [[hypercalcemia]]
- [[bone metastases]]
- [[Multiple myeloma]]
- [[Paget's disease of bone]]
- Skeletal disorders e.g. [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]] 

### Adverse effects
- [[Osteonecrosis of Jaw]] 
- Atypical femoral fractures
- [[Esophagitis]]
	- Oral should be taken in the morning with plenty of water at least 30 minutes before food and other medication, and the patient should maintain an upright position for at least 30 minutes after intake to prevent esophagitis.
- [[Hypocalcemia]] after IV administration 
- Renal Impairment 
- Musculoskeletal pain
- Infusion reaction 
- [[Atrial fibrillation]] 

### Contraindications
- Esophageal abnormalities
- Cannot sit upright for at least 30min
- Hypersensitivity
- For Zolendronic acide
	- [[Hypocalcemia]]
	- Reduced Creatinine Clearance
- Pregnancy/Lactation ?
