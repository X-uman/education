### Prevalence
- Approx. 1:650 population in the US [9]
- One of the most common causes of male hypogonadism
### Etiology
- Usually due to nondisjunction of sex chromosomes during meiosis
- Associated with advanced maternal age
### Karyotype
- 47,XXY (rarely 48,XXXY or 48,XXYY)
- Presence of a Barr body (inactivated X chromosome)
### Pathophysiology 
- Testicular dysgenesis leads to:
	- Seminiferous tubules dysgenesis → loss of Sertoli cells → ↓ inhibin B → ↑ FSH
	- Leydig cell dysfunction → ↓ testosterone → ↑ LH
	- Both ↑ LH and ↑ FSH lead to increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
### Clinical features: 
- Testicular dysgenesis and subsequent [[hypoandrogenism]] manifest at the onset of puberty (symptoms are rare during childhood).
- [[Global developmental delay]] 
	- Neurocognitive dysfunction (impaired executive function and memory, decreased intelligence) 
	- Language impairment (affects expression more than comprehension)
	- Poor social skills
- Associated disorders
	- [[Mitral valve prolapse]]
	- Increased risk of 
		- [[Breast cancer]]
		- [[Testicular cancer]] 
	- [[Metabolic syndrome]]

### Diagnostics
- Clinical presentation
- Hormone levels
	- ↑ FSH and LH
	- ↓ Testosterone with ↑ aromatase and ↑ estrogen levels
	- Testicular biopsy (performed after puberty) 
		- Seminiferous tubules fibrosis
		- Leydig cells hyperplasia
- Karyotyping: confirmatory test
### Treatment
- life-long testosterone substitution
