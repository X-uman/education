Sure, here's a tabulated summary of the risks of HIV transmission per exposure route:

| Transmission Route                   | Risk per Exposure                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sexual Transmission**              |                                                  |

| Viral Load < 400 copies/ml           | Lower likelihood of transmission                 |
| Circumcision                         | Reduced risk for circumcised men                 |
| Co-infection                         | Genital inflammation increases transmission risk |
| Genital Mucosal Damage               | Increases risk of transmission                   |
| **Parenteral Transmission**          |                                                  |
| Needle Sharing                       | 0.67% per exposure through needle-sharing        |
| Needlestick Injuries                 | 0.36% per injury                                 |
| Infectious Blood on Mucous Membranes | 0.1% per exposure                                |
| Blood Transfusions                   | 0.00005% risk per transfusion (1 in 2 million)   |
| **Vertical Transmission**            |                                                  |
