### Applications
- [[Guillian-Barre Syndrome]]
- [[Immune thrombocytopenia purpura]]
- [[Kawasaki disease]]: 2 g/kg over 12 h results in rapid defervescence and resolution in most patients and more importantly reduces risk of Coronary aneurysms 
- [[Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome]]
- [[Rh Incompatibility]]: Dose range for IVIG: 500â€“1000 mg/kg 

### Doses
- **GBS**
	- 0.4 gm/kg daily infusion for 5 d
	- Administer within 2 weeks of onset
	- Look for allergic reactions due to IgG antibodies due to IgA deficiency patient 
- [[Kawasaki disease]]
	- 2 g/kg over 12 h results in rapid defervescence and resolution in most patient and reduces incidence of [[Coronary aneurysms]] 
### Uses in pregnancy
- Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) with or without plasma exchange can maintain the fetal hematocrit above life-threatening levels.
- This approach may allow for achieving a gestational age when intrauterine transfusion is technically feasible and less likely to be associated with fetal death.
- In a study, fetal death occurred in 6 out of 30 fetuses who underwent intrauterine transfusion before 24 weeks.
- A multicenter retrospective review found that initiating weekly IVIG infusions before 13 weeks of gestation delayed the development of severe anemia by 25 days compared to previous pregnancies.
- Various therapeutic regimens, including IVIG and plasma exchange, have been described in case reports and small case series.
- According to the American Society for Apheresis guidelines, intrauterine transfusion is the mainstay of treatment, but IVIG and/or therapeutic plasma exchange may be indicated if there is a high risk of fetal demise or signs of hydrops before 20 weeks of gestation.
