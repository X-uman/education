A for Absent copper and B for a Bunch of copper: 
- In Menkes disease, the ATP7A gene is defective, resulting in decreased copper levels. 
- In [[Wilson disease]], the ATP7B gene is defective, which leads to high copper levels.

[[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]] and Menkes disease are both associated with reduced lysyl oxidase activity, resulting in defective [[collagen cross-linking]] and fibril synthesis.
