- [[Microangiopathic hemolysis]] mainly in liver?
- Medical emergency: Patient presents with RUQ/Epigastric pain + Severe vomiting
- Prevalence ranges from 0.1 of normotensive pregnancies to 1 percent of pregnant people with preeclampsia without severe features, depending on the diagnostic criteria used.
- 15% do not have Hypertension or Proteinuria
- Organs: Liver, kidney, brain, placenta
- 20% develop [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] 
- Patient needs Emergency delivery regardless of period of gestation

### Risk factors
- Prior history of HELLP
- Genetic variants

### Pathogenesis
- [[complement pathway]]-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy: treatment with [[Eculizumab]] was associated with marked improvement and complete normalization of lab parameters for 16 days after which it recurred
- fetal long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency
- [[Microangiopathic hemolysis]] and activation of [[microvascular thrombosis]] 
- Hepatic histology may show microvascular fibrin deposition, neutrophilic infiltrate, fatty infiltration, lobular necrosis, and periportal hemorrhage

### Presentation
- symptoms typically develop between 28 and 37 weeks of gestation, but onset in the late second trimester or at term/postpartum is also common
- [[Proteinuria in pregnancy]]
- Malaise
- Hypertension
- RUQ pain + tenderness: pain is severe and usually constant but can be fluctuating and colicky
	- [[Subcapsular hematoma]] or intraparenchymal hematoma and rupture may lead to severe pain, hypotension and tachycardia; shoulder, chest, or back pain
	- Patients with severe epigastric or right upper quadrant pain should undergo an appropriate imaging study expeditiously to evaluate for hepatic bleeding, even if liver enzymes are not severalfold above the normal range.
- Nausea, vomiting
- Headache
- Visual changes
- Jaundice (least common)
- [[mucocutaneous bleeding]] is an unusual presentation because platelet depletion is not severe enough to cause bleeding
- Some HELLP cases are complicated by Eclampsia 
- Other manifestations of [[Preeclampsia]] can be present
	- [[placental abruption]]
	- [[AKI.canvas|AKI]]
	- [[Pulmonary edema]]
	- [[Retinal detachment]] 
	- [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] 

### Diagnostics
- [[Hemolytic markers]]
- [[Liver function tests]]
- [[Renal Function Tests]] 
- The coagulation studies are obtained to rule out acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) in the absence of abruption and severe thrombocytopenia.
- [[Tennessee classification]] 
### Management
- [[Magnesium Sulfate for seizure prophylaxis]]
- Treat severe hypertension ([[Anti-hypertensive drugs in pregnancy]])
- If GA below limit of viability or > 34 WOG: Deliver
- If no, check for
	- FHR
	- Fetal death
	- Placental abruption
	- Pulmonary edema
	- Eclampsia
	- Hepatic bleeding
	- Stroke
	- AKI
	- DIC
- If none of the above are present, administer a course of betamethasone (for [[Fetal lung maturity]]) and deliver after 48 h if mother and fetus remain stable
- Vaginal birth is desirable in absence of standard indications for C.S. 
- In patients with HELLP complicated by hepatic bleeding, we suggest [[Cesarean Section]] because the increased intrabdominal pressure during vomiting and pushing can lead to further hepatic bleeding, even in patients who have undergone embolization by interventional radiology.
### Complications
- Hepatic hemorrhage
- [[Prematurity or preterm birth]] 

### Differential diagnosis
- [[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]]
- [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura]]
- Pregnancy related complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy
- [[SLE]]
