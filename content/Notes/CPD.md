### Definition
- Cephalopelvic disproportion at the outlet is defined as one where the biparietal-sub-occipito-bregmatic plane fails to pass through the bi-spinous and anteroposterior planes of the outlet.
### Etiology

##### Big fetal head
- [[macrosomia]] 
- [[Notes/Hydrocephalus]] 
- [[asynclitism]] 
- [[OP position]] 
##### Not enough passage
- [[Contracted pelvis]] 

### Presentation
-  [[Abnormal labor]] 
- Previous vaginal delivery rules out Contracted pelvis, but that does not rule out CPD

### Examination at term
- [[Clinical pelvimetry]] 
- [[CPD Examination]] 

### Diagnosis
- Imaging Pelvimetry 
- Imaging Cephalometry 

### Management
- Minor disproportion: [[Vaginal delivery]]
- Moderate disproportion: [[Trial of labor]]
- Major CPD/Failed TOL: [[Cesarean Section]] 

### Complications
- [[Fetal distress]] 
- [[Prolonged labor]] 
- [[Obstructed labor]]
