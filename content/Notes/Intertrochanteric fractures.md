### Management
#### Non-surgical
- Closed reduction using traction
	- Thomas splint
	- Russel's splint
- Internal Fixation 
	- [[Dynamic Hip Screw]] for stable fractures
	- [[Proximal femoral nail]] for Unstable fractures
- External fixation if patient has bed sores and are unfit for surgery 
- Open reduction: Valgus Osteotomy and reduction
---

### Complications
- Failed fixation due to [[Osteoporosis]]
- Malunion leading to [[Coxa vara]] and External rotation
- [[fracture nonunion]]
- [[Osteoarthritis]] due to change in biomechanics after fracture
