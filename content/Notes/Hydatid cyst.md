### Introduction  
- Hydatid cyst develops in intermediate host.
- Found in various organ of human and other intermediate hosts.
- Represents scolex of future [[Echinococcus spp.]] and remains invaginated within reticular body.
- Hydatid cyst in human is typically unilocular, sub-spherical in shape and is filled with fluid.
- Growth rate is 1-5 cm/year.
