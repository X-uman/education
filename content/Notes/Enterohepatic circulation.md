### Abnormalities
- Increased IHC of bilirubin in neonates might be a reason for pathological unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia like
	- [[bowel obstruction]]
	- [[Hirschsprung disease]]
	- [[cystic fibrosis]]
	- [[Breastmilk jaundice]]
	- [[Breastfeeding jaundice]]
	- [[Malnutrition]] 

### Prevention of excess EHC of bilirubin
- Frequent feeds with breast milk 
- Protein-rich nutrition in the form of breast milk or special formula feeds
- In the case of dehydration, protein-rich feeding solutions are preferred over glucose or water
- Glucuronidase is an intestinal enzyme that deconjugates conjugated bilirubin; once deconjugated, bilirubin is once again lipophilic and can be reabsorbed by the gut. Peptide fragments from proteins nonspecifically inhibit the enzyme glucuronidase and thus prevent enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. 

### Altered EHC in adults
- [[Ileal resection]]
- Ileal diseases
- Altered bowel transit time
- Altered bowel flora
- [[Cholestyramine]]
- Deoxycholate
