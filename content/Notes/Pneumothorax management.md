- In every patient with pneumothorax who requires mechanical ventilation, immediate tube thoracostomy should be performed first.
- Positive pressure ventilation can turn a simple pneumothorax into a life-threatening tension pneumothorax.

### Initial Management
- **Assessment of Size and Stability:**
    - Define size limits: <2 cm (small pneumothorax) and ≥2 cm (large pneumothorax).
    - Define stability: Criteria include respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and ability to speak in whole sentences.
    - For stable patients, management depends upon Apex-to-cupola distance

| Parameter                           | Normal Range/Condition in stable patient |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Respiratory Rate                    | Less than 24 breaths per minute          |
| Heart Rate                          | 60-120 beats per minute                  |
| Blood Pressure                      | Normal (not defined)                     |
| Room Air Oxygen Saturation          | Greater than 90 percent                  |
| Ability to Speak in Whole Sentences | Present                                  |

### Definitive Management
- Definitive treatment needed for 
	- High risk patients for recurrence
	- Prolonged air leak or PAL (>5 d)
	- Recurrent pneumothorax
	- Concomitant indication of [[Thoracoscopy]] 
1. **Initial Assessment:**
    - Differentiate between primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP).
    - Evaluate the severity of symptoms and consider factors such as age, sex, smoking history, and underlying lung disease.
    - Assess the risk factors for recurrence (e.g., smoking status, presence of blebs or bullae on imaging).
2. **Incidence of Recurrence:**
    - PSP: Recurrence rates range from 10% to 30% at one to five-year follow-up, with higher risk within the first year.
    - SSP: High recurrence rates, particularly in patients with COPD and other chronic lung diseases.
3. **Indications for Preventive Measures:**
    - Patients with prolonged air leak (>5 days), contralateral or bilateral pneumothorax, or life-threatening events should undergo definitive intervention.
    - First episode of SSP often warrants preventive measures due to high recurrence rates (>50%).

| **Definitive Measures**                                                                                                | **Nonsurgical Candidates (Chemical [[Pleurodesis]])**                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Video-assisted thoracic surgery ([[VATS]]) pleurodesis is preferred for its high efficacy and lower adverse effects. | - Intrapleural injection of chemical irritants like talc or tetracycline derivatives can be considered for patients unable or unwilling to undergo VATS. |
| - Blebectomy/bullectomy may be performed simultaneously with pleurodesis, particularly in SSP patients.                | - Graded talc or tetracycline derivatives have shown efficacy in preventing recurrence, with lower rates compared to nonsurgical approaches.             |
| - VATS is preferred over open [[thoracotomy]] due to lower recurrence rates and shorter hospital stays.                |                                                                                                                                                          |


2. **Follow-Up:**
    - Monitor patients closely post-procedure for closure of air leaks and lung expansion.
    - Chest tube removal can be considered once the air leak has ceased, and the patient's condition is stable.
    - Schedule outpatient follow-up to monitor for recurrence and assess lung function.
3. **Management of Prolonged Air Leak or Refractory Pneumothorax:**
    - If air leak persists or recurrence occurs despite pleurodesis, consider a multidisciplinary approach.
    - Options may include catheter-directed pleurodesis, thoracoscopic revision, endobronchial valve placement, or conservative management.
4. **Patient Education and Counseling:**
    - Discuss with patients the likelihood of recurrence, preventive measures, and potential complications associated with interventions.
    - Encourage smoking cessation and provide resources for support.
5. **Individualized Decision-Making:**
    - Consider patient preferences, values, and overall health status when determining the appropriate management approach.
    - Tailor treatment plans based on the severity of symptoms, recurrence risk, and underlying lung conditions.

#### Precautions
- **General Supportive Care:**
    - Administer supplemental oxygen as needed.
    - Treat underlying lung disease concurrently (e.g., COPD exacerbation, asthma attack).
- **Therapies to Avoid:**
    - Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) should generally be avoided.
    - Chest physical therapy should be individualized based on risk factors.
- **Disposition:**
    - Almost all patients with SSP should be hospitalized, except for rare stable patients with minimal symptoms and small SSP (<2 cm).

**Initial Management of Recurrent Event:**
- Patients ineligible or unwilling for a definitive procedure should undergo chest tube or catheter thoracostomy for recurrence.

**Initial Therapeutic Options:**
- Tube or catheter thoracostomy is preferred over simple aspiration for drainage.
- Consider size of the catheter or chest tube based on individual patient factors.

**Immediate Follow-up:**
- Patients with sealed air leak may proceed to preventive measures or discharge with ambulatory valve.
- Patients with prolonged air leak require definitive measures to seal the defect and prevent recurrence.

**Oxygen and Observation:**
- Suitable for clinically stable patients with small (<2 cm) asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic SSP.
- Administer supplemental oxygen cautiously, avoiding HFNC, especially in patients at risk for oxygen-induced hypercapnia.

**Aspiration:**
- Limited to stable patients with small SSP (<2 cm) and mild or no symptoms.
- Procedure should be performed in centers with expertise, with a lower threshold for admission following aspiration.
