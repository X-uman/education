### Pathogenesis
### Risk Factors
- Children: Self limiting
- Adults: Chronic
- Primary
- Secondary: Similar triggers as [[Antiphospholipid Syndrome]] 

### Etiology
- Primary ITP: No underlying cause, just autoantibodies, seen after viral infections
- Secondary ITP
	- Autoimmune diseases: [[SLE]], [[Antiphospholipid Syndrome]]
	- Malignancy: [[Leukemia]], [[Lymphomas]], [[Chronic lymphoid leukemia]] 
	- HIV, HCV
	- Drugs: Quinine 

### Pathophysiology
- Disorder of [[primary hemostasis]] 
- Development of antibodies against Antigens present on surface of platelets like [[Glycoprotein 2b-3a]] or [[glycoprotein Ib]] 
- [[Opsonization]] of [[platelets]]
- Phagocytosis by [[Macrophages]] in [[Spleen]]
- Resultant [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]]
- Other [[Blood Components]] unaffected
- Bone marrow responds by increasing platelet production
- Immature forms are released into blood
### Clinical Features
- Mostly asymptomatic
- mostly children, M > F
- Typically after a viral infection, 80% self resolving within 1 year 
- If platelet count falls too low: [[mucocutaneous bleeding]] 
- Acute onset of [[hemorrhage]]: [[Skin]], [[Mucosal Membranes]]
	- [[Petechiae, Purpura, Ecchymosis]]
	- [[Hematuria]]
- Clinical Classification
- **No lymphadenopathy, nor splenomegaly**
- No Pallor [[Notes/Hemolysis]] 
- No icterus 

## Diagnosis
#### Physiological 
- [[Complete Blood Count]]: 
	- [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]]
	- [[Hemoglobin]] normal/decreased according to severity of [[hemorrhage]]
- Peripheral blood smear: [[Megakaryocytes]] (immature platelets)
- Prolonged [[Bleeding time]]  
- Coagulation panel (PT/PTT) : Normal 
- Bone Marrow Biopsy: Not routinely indicated, done to rule out other suspected pathologies
 - Additional testing as required: consider in suspected secondary ITP, e.g., antinuclear antibodies in SLE or H. pylori testing if the patient has GI symptoms or is from a high prevalence area 

### Management
##### Symptomatic
- No [[NSAIDs]] (exacerbates bleeding)
- Follow-up if no or mild bleeding 
##### Definitive
- Life threatening bleeding/Intracranial bleeding/anticipated surgery 
	- [[Glucocorticoids]]
		- Prednisolone
		- Dexamethasone
		- Methylprednisolone 
	- [[IV Immunoglobulins]] or [[Anti-D Immunoglobulin]] 
	- Platelet transfusion
	- Control hemorrhage  
	- Refractory: [[Thrombopoitin receptor agonists]]
- No life threatening bleed: Corticosteroids or IVIG 
- Indications for observation
        - Children: no symptoms or only mild mucocutaneous bleeding with any platelet count
- Subsequent therapeutic options 
	- [[Thrombopoietin receptor agonists]] (TPO-RAs)
	- [[Rituximab]] 
	- [[Splenectomy]] if does not resolve by 1 year

## Prognosis
- Majority resolved spontaneously within 6 months
- [[Chronic ITP]]
