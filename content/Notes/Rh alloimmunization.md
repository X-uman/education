### Etiology
- [[Rh Incompatibility]] 
 - injection with needles contaminated by RhD-positive blood, or inadvertent transfusion of RhD-positive blood
### Pathogenesis
- [[Fetomaternal hemorrhage]] 
- Sensitization of mother towards Rh antigens
- Formation of Ig-G antibodies
- Migration of IgG antibodies through placenta in subsequent pregnancies
- [[Extravascular Hemolysis]] chronically in the fetus
- Fetal anemia that leads to heart failure and resultant generalized edema (hydrops fetalis)
- Bone marrow in attempt to compensate severe anemia, releases immature RBCs (erythroblasts)

### Diagnostics during pregnancy 
- Testing fetal DNA in maternal circulation (non invasive no risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage) 
- [[Rh antibody screening]] 
	- Testing [[Fetomaternal hemorrhage]] 
- Severity of fetal anemia can be monitored by 
	- PUBS: percutaneous Umbilical blood sampling
	- [[Transcranial doppler]] of MCA
- Similar to [[Vitamin B12 deficiency]] ????
- Monocyte Monolayer Assay (MMA)
- Monocyte Chemiluminescence (MCL)
- Antibody Dependent Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
- [[Amniocentesis]] and Spectroscopy of bilirubin: To estimate the degree of hemolysis???? After Antibody titer is too high

| Management Principles                            | Principles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Determine Fetal RhD Type:**                 | - Fetal RhD type may be determined by testing fetal DNA in maternal serum or inferred if paternal RHD gene testing reveals homozygosity and paternity is assured.                                                                                                       |
| **2. Monitor for Fetal Anemia:**                 | - Monitoring depends on the clinical scenario and may involve:   <br>  - Following maternal anti-D titers.<br>  - Ultrasound assessment of fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV).                                                               |
| **3. Consider Plasmapheresis and IVIG Therapy:** | - Serial combined maternal plasmapheresis and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy may be considered:    <br> - In cases of significantly elevated titers (>1024).    <br> - With a history of previous severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). |
| **4. Confirm Severe Fetal Anemia:**              | - Suspected severe anemia based on MCA-PSV should be confirmed by fetal blood sampling to determine fetal hemoglobin/hematocrit levels.                                                                                                                                 |
| **5. Treat Severe Fetal Anemia:**                | - Near term: Delivery for neonatal treatment.  <br> - Remote from term (<35 weeks gestation): Intrauterine fetal transfusions.                                                                                                                                          |

This table provides a concise overview of the management principles involved in handling pregnancies complicated by maternal alloimmunization.


### Prevention
- ABO and [[Rh antibody screening]] of the mother
	- Screening for Anti-D antibodies
		- Unsensitized: repeat at 28 WOG and at delivery
		- Sensitized mothers (>1:8): further monitoring with [[Amniocentesis]] and imaging is required for evidence of hemolysis
- [[Fetomaternal hemorrhage]] screening 
- [[Rh prophylaxis]] 

### Management of 1st pregnancy
1. **Determine Fetal Risk:**
    - If the biological father of the fetus is RhD-negative:
        - The fetus must also be RhD-negative.
        - No further evaluation or monitoring is necessary.
    - If the biological father of the fetus is RhD-positive:
        - Determine paternal zygosity.
        - Perform cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing on maternal plasma to determine fetal RHD type.
2. **Paternal Zygosity Testing:**
    - Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the number of RHD genes.
    - All offspring of RhD-positive homozygotes will be RhD-positive.
    - Offspring of heterozygotes have a 50% chance of being RhD-positive.
3. **Cell-free DNA Testing:**
    - Determine fetal RHD genotype using cfDNA analysis.
    - Test maternal plasma after 10 weeks of gestation.
    - Analyze RHD exons to detect fetal cfDNA presence.
    - Confirm fetal DNA presence using Y chromosome gene sequences (SRY) or maternal SNP analysis.
4. **Follow Maternal Anti-D Titers:** see [[Rh antibody screening]] 
    - Monitor maternal anti-D titers until a critical titer is reached.
    - Perform serial titers monthly, then every two weeks once the titer reaches a critical level.
    - Use gel microcolumn assay (GMA) for more reliable results.
5. **Assess for Severe Anemia using MCA-PSV:**
    - Perform Doppler velocimetry of the middle cerebral artery (MCA-PSV) after 20 weeks of gestation.
    - MCA-PSV >1.5 MoMs indicates risk of severe anemia.
    - Adjust for gestational age and repeat as needed.
6. **Delivery Timing:**
    - Deliver between 37 and 38 weeks if no intrauterine transfusion was performed and MCA-PSV remains <1.5 MoMs.
    - Consider delivery if MCA-PSV >1.5 MoMs at ≥35 weeks of gestation.
    - Induce labor approximately three weeks after the last transfusion if intrauterine transfusion was performed.
7. **Special Considerations:**
    - For severe anemia before 24 weeks, consider [[IV Immunoglobulins]] or plasma exchange.
    - Manage pregnancies with multiple antibodies closely.
    - Prevent affected fetus in future pregnancies using IVF with preimplantation genetic testing, gestational carrier, or donor sperm.
8. **Prognosis and Follow-up:**
    - Monitor for neonatal HDFN and manage accordingly.
    - Provide information and support to patients regarding the condition and management options.
9. **Patient Education:**
    - Offer patient education materials explaining the condition, management strategies, and available support resources.
