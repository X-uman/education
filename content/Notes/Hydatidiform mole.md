### Definition
- Lesions characterized by abnormal proliferation of trophoblast of the placenta
- This category is comprised of benign, non-neoplastic lesions, including placental site nodule

### Risk factors
- Prior molar pregnancy
- Advanced maternal age (> 40 y): unhealthy ovum (empty ovum)
- Asian and American Indian ancestry
### Classification
- [[Complete and partial mole]] 
- Placental site nodule
- Exaggerated placental site
---
### before u start
- [[Placenta]] 
- [[Early pregnancy bleeding]] 

### how it all started
- Extremes of ages of pregnancy 
- Sperm fertilizing empty ovum: [[Complete mole]]
- 2 sperms fertilizing non empty ovum: [[Partial mole]]
- [[Histological classification of GTD]] 
### then what?
- [[Î²-hCG]] 
### Presentation 
- Fundal height > GA
- Boggy uterus
- Anemia
- Lung metastatic lesions
- [[Complete vs partial mole]] 

Phantom HCG 

### Management
##### Patient preparation
1. [[Rh prophylaxis]] after treatment even if complete mole does not contain fetal RBCs
2. Treat symptomatic [[Hyperthyroidism]] with preferably Atenolol which are long acting [[Beta-Blockers]]
3. Treat severe [[Preeclampsia]] 
##### Procedures
- [[Dilation and evacuation]] 
	- At the time of anesthesia induction, an [[Oxytocin]] infusion is begun to promote uterine contraction
	- bleeding is typically substantially more than that encountered during evacuation of a pregnancy
- [[Hysterectomy]]: supracervical hysterectomy may be performed to reduce blood loss and avoid ureteral injury 
- [[Methotrexate in Hydatidiform mole]] 

### great to know
- [[Germ cell tumors]]
