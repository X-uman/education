- Misnomer
- exaggerated decrease in [[Blood Pressure]] by >=10mmHg during deep inspiration
- Cardiac causes
	- [[Pericardial Tamponade]] because outward expansion of heart is limited, the right ventricle expands during inspiration via the interventricular septum, which bulges into the left ventricle. This effect leads to further reduction in left ventricular filling during inspiration, resulting in decreased stroke volume and a subsequent drop in blood pressure
	- [[Constrictive pericarditis]]
- Pulmonary: Increased effort of respiration creates excessively negative intrathoracic pressure
	- Acute severe [[Asthma]]
	- [[COPD]]
	- [[Tension Pneumothorax]] 
- [[SVC syndrome]] 
- [[Anaphylaxis]]
