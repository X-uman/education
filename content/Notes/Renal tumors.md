Here's a comparison of the three types of renal cell carcinomas:

| Characteristic         | Clear Cell Carcinoma                                                                                                                     | Papillary Cell Carcinoma                                                                                                 | Chromophobe Carcinoma                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commonness             | Most common type                                                                                                                         | Second most common type                                                                                                  | Third most common type                                                                       |
| Cell Characteristics   | Clear cytoplasm, nonpapillary                                                                                                            | Papillary growth pattern                                                                                                 | Prominent cell membranes, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm                                        |
| Pathogenesis           | Mutation of VHL gene: [[Von Hippelâ€“Lindau disease]]                                                                                      | Not associated with 3p deletions; common cytogenetic abnormalities include trisomies 7 and 17                            | Multiple chromosome loss and extreme hypoploidy                                              |
| Gross Appearance       | Spherical, bright-yellow gray-white mass, often in upper pole of kidney                                                                  | Hemorrhagic and cystic, papillary formations within cysts                                                                | Tan-brown cut surface                                                                        |
| Microscopic Appearance | Variable growth pattern, round or polygonal cells with clear or granular cytoplasm, well-differentiated with some showing nuclear atypia | Cuboidal to low columnar cells arranged in papillary formations, interstitial foam cells, psammoma bodies may be present | Pale eosinophilic cells with perinuclear halo, arranged in solid sheets around blood vessels |
