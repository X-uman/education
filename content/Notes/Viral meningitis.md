### Risk factors
- [[X-lined agammaglobulinemia]] 

### Causative agents
- [[Enteroviruses]] (especially [[coxsackie virus]] and echovirus): the most common cause of meningitis in all patient groups
- [[Herpes viruses]]: HSV (meningitis is more commonly caused by HSV2 than HSV1)
- [[Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus]] (LCMV)
- [[Mumps virus]]
- [[arboviruses]]; [[West Nile virus]]
- [[HIV]]: Cranial nerve palsies like V, VII and VIII more common than other infection
- [[JC virus]] 

### Presentation
- [[Viral prodrome]] 
- Meningitis features see in [[Bacterial meningitis]]
- [[Meningismus]] 
- Maculopapular rash in enterovirus 

### Management
- Start [[Acyclovir]] with Viral meningoencephalitis until HSV is ruled out even if CSF is initially normal 
	- Seriously ill patients should probably receive intravenous acyclovir (15–30 mg/kg per day in three divided doses), which can be followed by 
	- oral drug such as acyclovir (800 mg five times daily), famciclovir (500 mg tid), or valacyclovir (1000 mg tid) for a total course of 7–14 days.
