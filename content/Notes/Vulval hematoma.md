Type of [[intralevator hematoma]]
![[Pasted image 20231008220530.png]]

### Presentation
Pressure symptoms:
	- Severe perineal pain: Tense vaginal swelling, dusky, purple, tender
	- [[Tenesmus]] if extends to [[ischiorectal fossa]]
	- [[Urine Retention]]
- Shock

#### Management
- If possible, vulvar hematomas are best left undisturbed so as to avoid introducing bacteria and undertaking a potentially difficult surgical procedure
- Bleeding leading to a vulvar hematoma is often venous and from multiple sites, thus it can be difficult to isolate and control surgically.
- Size < 5 cm: Cold compression and Pain management 
- Expansion of a vulvar or vaginal hematoma or a falling hematocrit are indications for prompt surgical intervention as persistent hemorrhage can lead to hemodynamic instability and other complications
- If bleeding vessels are not ligated adequately before the edges are closed, another hematoma may develop. However, in many cases, the vessels cannot be identified so the incision is closed and a drain is left in place 
### Larger hematoma
- [[EUGA]] with [[Immediate hemodynamic support]] if larger
	- Scoop out blood clots and [[primary hemostasis]] 
- Obliterate [[Dead space]] using in interrupted or figure-of-eight stitches of monofilament absorbable suture to avoid trapping bacteria.
- [[drains]] may be helpful as incision exposes the underlying tissues to a nonsterile environment
- [[Foley's catheter]] 
- [[Prophylactic antibiotics]]
