### Management
| Component                                                                         | Indications                                                      | Effects                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plasma                                                                            | PT and/or aPTT >1.5 times control due to dilutional coagulopathy | Increase clotting protein levels by approximately 2.5% in adult                                             |
| Fibrinogen                                                                        | Fibrinogen levels critically low (<100 mg/dL)                    | Raise fibrinogen levels in critically low situations                                                        |
| Platelets ((six units of whole blood WB-derived platelets or one apheresis unit)) | Platelet count <50,000/microL                                    | Each unit should increase the platelet count by 5000/microL (30,000/microL for a full six-unit adult dose). |
### Monitoring for prevention 
- Following tests are monitored to assess hemoglobin and [[Coagulation panel]] after each 5 units of pRBCs or as the clinical situation allows
	- CBC with platelet count
	- PT/PTT
	- Fibrinogen 
- [[Viscoelastic testing]] can be used instead of the PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen, but viscoelastic tests are less sensitive, less specific, slower, and more expensive
