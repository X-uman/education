| Characteristic                             | Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)                                                                                                                                              | Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD)                                                                                                                                  |

| Types                                      | Adult type (ADPKD)                                                                                                                                                                                | Childhood type (ARPKD)                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Genetics                                   | Autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance. Both alleles of the involved genes must be non-functional for disease development.                                                           | Autosomal recessive inheritance. Compound heterozygous mutation, inheriting different mutation alleles from each parent.                                                               |
| Prevalence                                 | 1 per 400 to 1000 live births.                                                                                                                                                                    | Less common compared to ADPKD.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Gene                                       | PKD1 gene (located on chromosome 16) and PKD2 gene (located on chromosome 4).                                                                                                                     | PKHD1 gene (located on chromosome 6).                                                                                                                                                  |
| Protein Encoded                            | Polycystin-1 (PKD1 gene) and Polycystin-2 (PKD2 gene).                                                                                                                                            | Fibrocystin (PKHD1 gene).                                                                                                                                                              |
| Expression                                 | Polycystin-1 is expressed in distal tubular cells. Polycystin-2 is expressed in all segments of renal tubules and many extra-renal tissues.                                                       | Fibrocystin is expressed in adult and fetal kidney, liver, and pancreas.                                                                                                               |
| Functionality                              | Polycystin-1 responsible for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Polycystin-2 involved in calcium transportation (functions as a calcium permeable cation channel).                           | Fibrocystin acts as a cell surface receptor with a role in collecting duct and biliary differentiation.                                                                                |
| Disease Severity                           | PKD1 mutations account for 85% of cases. Likely to produce more severe disease, with a higher likelihood of developing renal failure as age advances.                                             | Less likelihood to develop renal failure than PKD1 mutation. Produces less severe disease compared to ADPKD.                                                                           |
| Pathogenesis                               | Mutation of PKD1 and PKD2 genes leads to altered mechanosensation by cilia and calcium influx, resulting in abnormal tubular growth and differentiation, leading to renal damage.                 | Mutation in PKHD1 gene leads to altered cellular function in collecting ducts and biliary ductules, causing cyst formation and hepatic injury.                                         |
| Morphology                                 | Both kidneys are massively enlarged, appearing composed mainly of cysts with functioning nephrons dispersed between the cysts.                                                                    | Both kidneys are enlarged, with multiple cysts in the cortex and medulla, giving a spongelike appearance. Dilated elongated channels present, completely replacing cortex and medulla. |
| Clinical Features                          | Many patients remain asymptomatic until renal insufficiency develops, commonly between 40-60 years of age.                                                                                        | Serious manifestations usually present at birth, and infants may succumb rapidly to renal failure. May manifest with hepatic disease and portal hypertension.                          |
| Associated Extrarenal Congenital Anomalies | Up to 40% have liver cysts (polycystic liver disease). Intracranial berry aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and other cardiac valvular abnormalities may also be present. Also [[Diverticulosis]] | - In almost all the cases, liver has cysts associated with Portal Fibrosis and Proliferation of Portal Bile ducts                                                                      |
