## roots
- [[Estrogen]]: [[Estrogen exposure]] 
Leiomyomas appear as concentric, hypoechoic, heterogeneous masses on ultrasound. The presence of calcifications or cystic areas suggests necrosis.

## Stem
- whorled pattern + [[Neovascularization]] 
	- Benign variants:
		- Atypical
		- Cellular
		- Metastasizing: Lungs via blood stream
- Manage symptoms
- Remove blood supply
- Remove growth stimulants: Decrease its size by removing Estrogen exposure 
- Remove the mass
- Remove the uterus 

## branches
- Increased surface area: Bleeding, anemia
	- [[GnRH antagonists]] + OCPs : Reduce proliferation of [[endometrium]]  
	- Reduce frequency of menstrual cycle: [[OCPs]], Hormonal IUD
	- Reduce [[Fibrinogen]] breakdown

- [[Mass Effect]]: 
	- [[GnRH agonists]] bridging the procedures like
	- [[Uterine artery embolization]] 
	- [[Radiofrequency ablation]] 

Surgical excision:
	- [[Myomectomy]]: Preserves Fertility
	- [[hysterectomy]] 

## Mimics
- [[Endometrial polyps]] and Submucosal leiomyoma
- [[Adenomyosis]]
- [[Endometriosis]] 
- [[Hydatidiform mole]] 

## Analogy
- [[Thyroid Adenoma]]  
- [[Thyroid ablation]] leads to [[Hypothyroidism]], Blocking pituitary leads to [[hypoestrogenism]], so replacement is necessary 
- Embolization in [[Glomus tumor]] 
- Anti testosterone hormone ([[Flutamide]]) is given in [[Angiofibroma]] before surgery as [[GnRH agonists]] or Antagonists are given
