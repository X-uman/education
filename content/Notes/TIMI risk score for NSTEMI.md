- The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score is considered a tool for early risk stratification. According to several trials, notably TIMI 11B and ESSENCE, seven factors help assess the mortality risk and risk of other adverse cardiac events, as listed below.
	1. Age of 65 years or older
	2. [[cardiac biomarkers]] 
	3. Presence of at least three [[Cardiovascular risk factors]] 
	4. Aspirin drug use in the past seven days
	5. ST-segment deviations greater than or equal to 0.05 mV on initial ECG at admission
	6. Presence of greater than or equal to 2 episodes of angina 24 hours before the presentation
	7. Previous history of coronary stenosis of 50% or more
The following represents scores paired with the percent risk of mortality, new/recurrent MI, or severe ischemia requiring further invasive cardiac intervention.
    - 4.7% for a score of 0/1
    - 8.3% for a score of 2
    - 13.2% for a score of 3
    - 19.9% for a score of 4
    - 26.2% for a score of 5
    - 40.9% for a score of 6/7
In conclusion, early invasive management, such as cardiac angiography and revascularization, is recommended for patients presenting with a TIMI risk score greater than or equal to 3. Patients with a TIMI risk score of 0Â to 2 should be managed medically.
Perhaps the greatest utility that the TIMI score has to offer is its ability to guide the management of patients presenting with signs of unstable angina/non-ST elevated myocardial infarctions (UA/NSTEMI).
Question: Whether to do invasive intervention or medical treatment
	- No difference in low risk patients
	- High risk: Enoxaparin reduces risk of major cardiac events compared to unfractionated [[Unfractionated heparin]] 
	- Significant benefit of using [[Glycoprotein 2b-3a]] inhibitors with TIMI score >=4 in addition to Aspirin and heparin
