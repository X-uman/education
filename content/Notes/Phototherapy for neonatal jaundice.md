- Most effective wavelength is 420-470 nm
- Phototherapy is the primary treatment in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
### Indications
- For infants born ≥ 35 weeks gestation, threshold bilirubin levels (TSB) for treatment are based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) phototherapy nomogram, which divides the infants into three risk groups: 
    - Low-risk infants: ≥ 38 weeks and well
    - Medium-risk infants: ≥ 38 weeks with risk factors (e.g., isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, sepsis), or 35-37 weeks and well
    - High-risk infants: 35-37 weeks with risk factors 
### Contraindications
- Concomitant use of photosensitizing medications
- [[Congenital erythropoietic porphyria]]
- Family history of [[porphyria]]

### Mechanism of action
1. Structural isomerization
	- Fast and irreversible 
	- formation of lumirubin (water soluble)
2. Photo-isomerization
	- Conversion from Z to E forms
	- Slow and reversible
	- Bilirubin converted into polar compound which is excreted via kidney without conjugation
- Photo-oxidation
	- Bilivertine, Dipyrroles, Monopyrroles

### Effectiveness depends upon
- Exposed surface area
- Distance between light source and baby (usual distance is 30-45 cm)
- LED lamps are more effective 
- Does not depend upon skin pigmentation

### Assessment of effectiveness
- Irradiance should at least 30 microwatt/cm2/nm which can be measured using Flux meter
- With intensive phototherapy, the total serum bilirubin level should decline by 1–2 mg per dL. After phototherapy, the levels of total bilirubin should be determined from a serum sample; transcutaneous bilirubin measurement may yield falsely low values. 
 - Continued until total bilirubin levels < 15 mg/dL 
- Adequate fluid supplementation to prevent dehydration
- Eye protection to prevent retinal damage
### Adverse effects
- Watery diarrhea due to bilirubin isomers
- Dehydration due to insensible water losses
- [[Hypocalcemia]]
- Retinal toxicity if not covered
- Gonadal toxicity in not covered
- Impaired maternal child bonding 
- Bronze baby syndrome (reversible, rare)
    - Occurs in infants with elevated direct bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin > 2mg/dL) following phototherapy
    - Thought to be caused by abnormal accumulation of bronze-colored pigments (photoisomers of bilirubin) within the skin
    - Presents with a reversible grayish-brown discoloration of the skin, urine, and serum
    - Usually resolves slowly after cessation of phototherapy without complications
