### Definition
- TIA refers to temporary, focal cerebral ischemia that results in reversible neurological deficits without acute infarction (i.e., imaging findings show no signs of infarction).
- Increased risk of future ischemic stroke 
	- Within 2 days: ∼ 3–10%
	- Within 90 days: ∼ 9–17%
### Etiology
- Similar to [[Ischemic Stroke]]
- Examples of possible underlying causes 
	- Embolism from [[Atrial fibrillation]]
	- [[Hypertensive vasculopathy]]
	- Large vessel [[Atherosclerosis]] 
	- [[Hypercoagulable state]] 
	- [[Infective endocarditis]] 
	- [[Paradoxical embolism]] 
	- [[Aortic dissection]] 
### Clinical features
- Acute transient [[Focal neurological deficits]]
- In majority of patients, symptoms last < 15 min (typically < 1 h)
- Possibly [[Amaurosis Fugax]] (transient blindness like curtain dropping from above)
### Can involve any of CNS other than [[Brain]]
- [[Retina]]: is [[Amaurosis Fugax]]:TIA in retina 
- [[Cochlea]]: [[Anterior inferior cerebellar artery]]
- [[Spinal cord]] 
### Diagnostics
- Establish clinical diagnosis
- Obtain ECG and Glucose
- Rule out alternate diagnoses
- Complete TIA diagnostics within 24-48 h of symptom onset to identify cause and ensure timely prevention
- Perform Risk factor scoring like [[ABCD² score]] 
- Reduce subsequent stroke risk using pharmacotherapy 
### Radiological features
- [[Diffusion Weighed Imaging]] is normal i.e. No [[Cell Injury]] has occurred.
- Recovery within 24 hrs
#### Management
- [[Neurological emergency]]: Admission management same as stroke to prevent [[Stroke]] development in future, 
- There is highest risk in next week, or months of developing stroke 

### Prognosis
- [[ABCD² score]] for 2 day risk of stroke
- [[Canadian TIA score]] for 7 day risk of stroke
### Treatment
- Start within 24 h after ruling out intracranial hemorrhage
	- Single Anti-platelet therapy
		- Aspirin 50–325 mg PO daily
		- Clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily
	- [[dual antiplatelet therapy]]: for short term if ABCD2 ≥ 4, continue for 21-90 days and then switch to monotherapy
	- [[Anticoagulants]] for [[Atrial fibrillation]] patients
- Risk assessment for bleeding
	- [[HAS-BLED score]] 
### Differential Diagnoses
- [[Migraine]]
- [[Seizures]]
- [[Transient Global Amnesia]]
- [[Amyloid Spells]]
