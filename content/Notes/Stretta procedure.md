During the Stretta procedure, the surgeon inserts an endoscope down the esophagus. This tube delivers radiofrequency waves to the area where the esophagus joins the stomach.


The radio waves create tiny cuts in the esophageal tissue. As these cuts heal, they form scar tissue that strengthens the area and blocks the nerves that respond to acid reflux.
