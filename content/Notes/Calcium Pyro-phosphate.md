[[Pseudogout]] 
#### Pathogenesis
- enhanced activity of ATP pyrophosphohydrolase and 5â€²-nucleotidase, which catalyze the reaction of ATP to adenosine and pyrophosphate. This pyrophosphate could combine with calcium to form CPPD
- crystals in matrix vesicles or on collagen fibers. There are decreased levels of cartilage glycosaminoglycans that normally inhibit and regulate crystal nucleation. High activities of transglutaminase enzymes also may contribute to the deposition of CPPD crystals.
- Release of CPPD crystals into the joint space is followed by the phagocytosis of those crystals by monocyte macrophages and neutrophils.
