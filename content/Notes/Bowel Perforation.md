### Causes
 - [[ischemia]]
 - [[Abdominal trauma]]
 - [[Peptic ulcer disease]]: DU located anteriorly

### Management
- [[Primary survey]] 
- Do X-ray immediately erect: 
	- [[Pneumoperitoneum]] 
- Gastrograffin CECT (Avoid [[Barium study]])
- Emergency [[Exploratory laparotomy]] 
- Complete Lavage of peritoneum to get rid of bile and acids
- Broad spectrum Antibiotics
- No vagotomy required in PU perforation 

##### definitive treatment for perforation of DU: 
- No vagotomy 
- Size < 1 cm: Direct closure using sutures
- Size 1-3 cm: [[Graham's Omental patch]] (Graham's patch), another option: [[Falciform ligament]] 
- Size > 3 cm: Jejunal serosal patch closure + [[Pyloric exclusion]] + Gastrojejunostomy to prevent [[Enterocutaneous fistula]] 

- Stable, early cases with less contamination: Truncal [[Vagotomy]] 

##### For GU: 
- No vagotomy
- Unstable: Omental patch closure + Biopsy
- Stable: Distal gastrectomy 
### Complications
- [[Chemical peritonitis]] due to Bile which later becomes bacterial [[Peritonitis]] 
- [[Valentino syndrome]] which resembles Appendicitis
- [[Peritoneal Abscesses]] in Spread infections
