### in insufficiency
- [[Amylase]] 
- [[Lipase]]
- [[Fecal elastase]] 
- [[72 h quantitative fecal fat estimation]] for [[steatorrhea]] 
- Serum [[trypsinogen]] 

### Direct tests
 - Cholecystokinin analog (cerulein), secretin, or a combination, are administered parenterally.
- Pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate levels of duodenal fluid are measured.
- Low amylase, lipase, trypsin, and bicarbonate levels are suggestive of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

The presence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (as confirmed by pancreatic function tests) is not required to establish a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis but can further support the diagnosis.
