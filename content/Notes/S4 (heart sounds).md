### Introduction
- Due to late diastolic contraction of the atria (atrial kick) against high ventricular pressure
- Heard best with the bell of the stethoscope in the mitral area with the patient lying in a left lateral position
- Late diastolic (presystolic) sound heard immediately before S1
- S1 rapidly follows S4, resembling the cadence of the word “Tennessee” (Ten-nes: S4, S1, see: S2) on auscultation.
- Physiological: advanced age
- Pathological if palpable
    - Ventricular hypertrophy (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis, cor pulmonale)
    - Ischemic cardiomyopathy
    - Acute myocardial infarction
