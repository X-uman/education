### Clinical features
A sudden decrease in arterial blood supply to an extremity resulting in symptoms or signs of ischemia for < 2 weeks duration; can threaten limb viability
### Etiologies
- Arterial thrombosis
	- [[Atherosclerosis]] 
	- Trauma and [[Arterial injury]]
	- Stent or graft thrombosis
	- Aneurysms thrombosis (commonly [[Popliteal aneurysm]])
	- [[Vasculitis]]
	- [[thrombophilia]] 
	- [[Hypercoagulable state]] 
- [[Arterial embolism]]
- Non-thromboembolic causes
	- [[Aortic dissection]]
	- [[Raynaud phenomenon]]
	- [[Notes/shock|shock]]
	- Vascular compression
		- [[Crush syndrome]]
		- [[Compartment syndrome]]
		- [[Thoracic outlet syndrome]]
		- [[Popliteal entrapment syndrome]]
		- [[AV access steal phenomenon]]
		- [[Phlegmasia cerula dolens]] 
### Clinical features
- 6P: as in [[Compartment syndrome]]
### Diagnostics
- Handheld doppler device
- [[Ankle brachial pressure index]] 
- Imaging
	- [[CT angiography]] 
	- [[Digital Subtraction Angiography]] 
	- [[Duplex USG]]
	- [[MR angiography]] 
- Other investigations
	- [[EKG]]
	- [[Echocardiography]]
### Classification
- [[Rutherford staging]] 

### Management
- Begin [[Anticoagulants]] like LMWH as soon as possible
- Manage according to Rutherford classification
### Complications
- Permanent nerve damage
- Limb [[Gangrene]]
- [[Reperfusion injury]]
