### Dosage
- Atropine Test
	- To ascertain if patient has ingested OP
	- Inject 1 mg Atropine IV: Pulse rate goes up by 25 or skin flushing develops, less likely
### Infusion rate titration
eg, clear lung auscultation, heart rate >80 beats/minute, systolic blood pressure >80 mmHg, dry axilla, pupils no longer pinpoint) without causing atropine toxicity (eg, confusion, pyrexia, absent bowel sounds, urinary retention).
