### Non-surgical
#### General Management
- Give oxygen, hyperventilation
	- Avoid hypoxia, but also do not give excessive oxygen (Free radical injury) 
- Monitor Carbon Dioxide: 
	- Avoid hypercapnia or hypocapnia (hypocapnia causes vasoconstriction and exacerbates brain hypoxia)
- Head position: Keep neck straight
- Sitting position at around 30 degrees: good drainage of CNS blood 
- Avoid [[Valsalva maneuver]]:
	- [[Antitussives]]
	- [[Laxatives]] 
- Treat fever
- Avoid [[Fluid overload]] 
- [[Seizure prophylaxis]] 
- [[Sedatives]] 

#### Medical management 
- IV [[Mannitol]] 20%
- IV [[Hypertonic saline]] 
- IV [[Dexamethasone]] if due to inflammation like due to TB, encephalitis, meningitis or Neoplasms
	- Avoid in [[Traumatic brain injuries]] , because more chances of infection
	- Avoid also in Subarachnoid hemorrhage 
### Surgical management 
- [[External ventricular drain]] especially if CSF is increased i.e. [[Notes/Hydrocephalus]] 
- [[Lumbar puncture]] is contraindicated due to chances of [[Brain Herniation]] 
- [[Ventricular shunts]] 
- [[Ventriculostomy]] 
- [[Craniotomy]] 
- [[Decompressive craniectomy]] 
- Treat underlying cause
