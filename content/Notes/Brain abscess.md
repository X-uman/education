### Stages of Brain abscess:
1. Invasion or Cerebritis/[[Encephalitis]] 1-10 days
2. Localization or Latent Abscess 10-14 days
3. Expansion or Manifest Abscess >14 days which causes increased ICP
4. Termination or Abscess rupture, leads to fatal meningitis

### Pathophysiology
- Local spread from [[Chronic Otitis]] to:
	- Temporal lobe through [[Tegmen tympani]]
	- [[Cerebellum]] through [[Trautman's triangle]]

### Presentation
- [[Space Occupying Lesion]]
- [[SIRS]] 
- Signs of [[meningitis]] 

### Management
- [[Abscess]] Management
- Abscess < 2.5 cm, Symptoms < 7 d and no raised ICP: Try Antibiotics without drainage
- Manage ICP
- Manage Seizure potential

### Diagnosis
- CECT: [[Ring Enhancement]] 
- Low signal on T1
- High signal on T2
- Medium signal on FLAIR
- Restricted diffusion

### DDX
- [[Neurocysticercosis]]
- [[Toxoplasmosis]]
- [[Primary CNS lymphoma]]
- [[Brain metastases]]
- Subacute [[hemorrhage]] and/or infarction
- [[Tuberculoma]]
- Radiation necrosis
- Demyelinating plaque
