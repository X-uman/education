### Mechanism
- Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator that opens potassium channels → potassium efflux from insulin-producing β cells → hyperpolarization of the cell membrane → negative membrane potential that inactivates and closes voltage-gated calcium channels → decreased influx of calcium into pancreatic cells → drop in intracellular calcium concentration → decreased exocytosis of insulin granules (side effects include sodium retention, edema, hirsutism, and hyperkalemia)
