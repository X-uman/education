### Introduction
- infection of the deep soft tissues that results in progressive destruction of the muscle fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat
- Infection typically spreads along the muscle fascia due to its relatively poor blood supply; muscle tissue is frequently spared because of its generous blood supply

### Types
- Polymicrobial
	- [[Fournier gangrene]]
	- [[Necrotizing infection of head and neck]]
	- usually occurs in [[immunocompromised status]]
	- Most important risk factor is Diabetes associated with [[peripheral arterial disease]] 
- Monomicrobial 
	- Can occur in any age group, and in individuals with no underlying comorbidities
	- MCC: [[Streptococcus pyogens]] 
	- Likely hematogenous route 
	- Likely source: [[Pharyngitis]] 
	- Necrotizing infection caused by GAS strains with M types 1 and 3 is associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in about 50 percent of cases
	- Other etiologies: associated with traumatic injury associated with water
		- [[Vibrio vulnificus infection]]
		- [[Aeromonas hydrophila]] 
	- Most causes of neonatal fasciitis in neonates present with abdominal or perineal involvement and are often due to beta-hemolytic streptococci
	- Polymicrobial infection occurs less often
	- Associated conditions include omphalitis, balanitis (related to circumcision), and hernia repair
### Presentation
- Features of NSTI
- diminished sensation to pain develops in the involved area, due to thrombosis of small blood vessels and destruction of superficial nerves in the subcutaneous tissue. 
- This may precede the appearance of skin necrosis and provide a clue to the presence of necrotizing fasciitis
- Subcutaneous gas is often present in the polymicrobial (type I) form of necrotizing fasciitis, particularly in patients with diabetes

### Pathology
- Characteristic pathologic features of necrotizing fasciitis include extensive tissue destruction, thrombosis of blood vessels, abundant bacteria spreading along fascial planes, and infiltration of acute inflammatory cells
