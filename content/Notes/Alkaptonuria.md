- Aka Ochronosis; Black urine disease 
- [[Autosomal recessive]]
- Disorder of [[Tyrosine]] metabolism
- Deficiency of Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme

### Upstream accumulation of
- [[Homogentisic acid]] in body, cartilages and excreted in urine, sweat which turns black due to polymerization. 
- The excess HGA binds to collagen in connective tissue.Â The affected connective tissues become weak and brittle with time, leading to chronic inflammation, degeneration, and osteoarthrosis (progressive arthropathy)
	- [[Osteoarthritis]], [[Chondrocalcinosis]], [[Syndesmophytes]] 
	- [[Intervertebral disc]] degeneration and calcification
	- [[Nephrolithiasis]] 
	- Sclera, ear discoloration after 30 y
	- [[Mitral Stenosis]], [[Aortic Stenosis]] 
	- [[Coronary Artery Disease]] 

### Clinical features
- Affected patients usually are asymptomatic in childhood
- In affected babies: change in urine color to brownish black, leading to diaper staining
- During the third decade, deposits of the brownish or bluish pigment become apparent, typically first in the ear cartilage and sclerae.
- The development of ochronotic arthritis results in limitation of motion and often complete ankylosis, resembling [[rheumatoid arthritis]] or [[osteoarthritis]]
- pigment is also deposited in the large joints and the spine, especially the lumbosacral region.
- Axillary and inguinal areas may have a brownish discoloration
- Perspiration can stain clothing in affected patients
- The mean ages for detection of cardiac valve involvement and coronary artery calcification were 54 and 59 years, respectively.
### Diagnostics
- Although the discoloration of urine in AKU is apparent in infancy, the diagnosis usually is made in adults during routine urinalysis or investigation of arthritis
- Normal Tyrosine levels
- Increased Homogentisate in urine and serum
	- Positive [[Benedict's test]]
	- Positive FeCl3 test
- X-ray: Parrot beak appearance
- cartilage's ocher (yellow) hue under the microscope.
### Management
- Benign condition
- Diet low in Tyrosine and Phenylalanine
- [[Vitamin C]] prevents deposition but has no effect on metabolic defect
- [[Nitisinone]] 

---
- Excessive application of [[Tyrosinase inhibitors]] leads to Exogenous Ochronosis which can cause darkening instead of lightening of skin
