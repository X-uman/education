- MCC is blunt trauma 
- MCC Artery is Intercostal artery 
- MCC Artery in massive hemothorax: Internal mammary Artery
- Other: Aorta, Pulmonary A. 

- [[Non-traumatic hemothorax]]
- [[Traumatic hemothorax]] 

### Investigations
- [[Chest X-ray]] shows effusions 
- [[eFAST]]
	- Normal: Seashore sign
- Hematocrit > 50% of blood 

### Management
- A hemothorax, however small, must always be drained because blood in the pleural cavity will clot if not evacuated, resulting in a trapped lung or an empyema.
Stabilize the patient.
	- Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions as needed (see “Massive transfusion protocol”)
	- Anticoagulant reversal (if applicable)
	- Chest tube insertion indicated for most patients
- Urgent thoracotomy indicated for [[Massive hemothorax]] (rare)
- Identify and treat the underlying cause. 
- Consult surgery or interventional radiology for bleeding from tumors or vascular pathology. 

### Management 
- immediate [[Chest tube]]
- definite [[Thoracotomy]] and pleural apposition  if there is [[Massive hemothorax]] 
- [[Angioembolization]] 
- [[VATS]] 

### Complications
- Pleural empyema
- Fibrothorax
- [[Trapped lung]]
