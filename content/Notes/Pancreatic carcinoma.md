### Risk factors
##### Exogenous
- Smoking
- [[Chronic pancreatitis]] 
- High alcohol consumption
- [[Diabetes Mellitus]] 
- [[Obesity]]
- Possible infections with [[H. pylori]] or [[HBV]] 
##### Endogenous
- African Americans and Jewish race
- Age > 50y
- Inherited genetic syndromes
	- [[FAMMM syndrome]]
	- [[HNPCC]]
	- [[BRCA1/BRCA2]]
	- [[Von Hippel–Lindau disease]]
	- [[Neurofibromatosis Type 1]]
	- [[MEN Syndrome]] type 1
	- Familial
	- PRSS1 mutation
	- [[Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome]] 

- Similar risk factors as [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]] 
- [[periampullary tumors]] 
- arise from [[pancreatic duct]] 
- [[adenocarcinoma]]
- head is commonest site: [[Obstructive jaundice]] and [[Notes/Pancreatitis]]: early presentation
	- USG: [[Double duct sign]], hypoechoic mass
	- [[Pain abdomen]] and weight loss: [[CECT]] 
	- [[ERCP]] 
	- FNAC: R/O [[Chronic pancreatitis]] and [[autoimmune pancreatitis]] 
- body, tail: grow large and spread through [[Retroperitoneum]] and [[perineural invasion]]: belt-like epigastric and back pain
- [[desmoplastic reaction]]
- [[pancreatic insufficiency]] 
- [[Neuroendocrine tumors]] 

### Clinical features
- Asymptomatic till late
- May present like [[Chronic pancreatitis]] 
- [[perineural invasion]]: Belt shaped epigastric pain radiating to back
- [[pancreatic insufficiency]]
- [[Obstructive jaundice]] which maybe painless
- [[Courvoisier sign]]
- [[trousseau sign]] 
- [[Liver metastases]] 
- [[Hypercoagulable state]] 
### Diagnostics
- CT scan findings
	- Poorly defined, hypodense/hypoechoic and hypovascular mass 
- Double-duct sign: simultaneous dilation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct due to tumors of the pancreatic head blocking bile drainage.  
#### Confirmation
- [[Endoscopic ultrasound]] 
- [[Tissue diagnosis]] 
	- Typically EUS guided, alternatively Percutaneous or CT-guided
	- Can help differentiate pancreatic cancer from pancreatitis and other malignant and benign lesions
##### Adjunctive investigations
- [[MRCP]]
- [[ERCP]] 
- Tumor markers
	- [[CA-19-9]] 
	- CEA
### Management 
- [[Pancreatic carcinoma staging and treatment]] 
- [[Whipple operation]] 
- [[Gastric reconstruction]] 
- Palliative:
	- [[Gemcitabine]] + [[tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] 
	- [[Pain management]]: [[Celiac ganglion block]] 

### Complications
- [[Cholestasis]]
- [[Gastric Outlet Obstruction]]: [[Gastroenterostomy]]
- Ileus: Gastrostomy
- [[pancreatic insufficiency]] 
- Cachexia 
- [[Hypercoagulable state]]

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Biliary obstruction            | ERCP with stent implantation (preferred)         | Percutaneous transhepatic bile duct drainage (PTCD) <br>Surgical bypass: consider in select patients when other measures fail or are not feasible. |
| [[Gastric Outlet Obstruction]] | Endoscopic stent placement                       | Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (or jejunostomy) Surgical bypass (e.g., gastroenterostomy)                                                     |
| Malignant ascites              | Cautious use of diuretics (e.g., spironolactone) | Intermittent paracentesis or placement of a long-term peritoneal drain                                                                             |
| Ileus                          | [Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ](PEG)      |                                                                                                                                                    |
### Screening
- Not recommended for asymptomatic individuals at average risk 
- Indicated for certain high-risk individuals, e.g.:  
	- Patients with genetic syndromes that increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, e.g., Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis
	- First-degree relatives of individuals who have pancreatic cancer and any of the following:
	- ≥ 2 genetic relatives with pancreatic cancer
	- Specific genetic markers (e.g., BRCA mutation)
	- Hereditary cancer syndrome (e.g., Lynch syndrome)
- Modalities include MRI and endoscopic ultrasound.
