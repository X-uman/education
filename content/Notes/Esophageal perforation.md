### Introduction


---
### Etiology
- [[Boerhaave's syndrome]]: 
	Barogenic/Spontaneous/[[Valsalva maneuver]]
- Iatrogenic: [[Endoscopy]]
- Trauma
- Malignancy
- [[Foreign body ingestion]] 
- [[Chemical burns]] 
---
### Pathogenesis
- Severe vomiting/increased intrathoracic pressure â†’ rupture of all layers of the esophageal wall (transmural perforation)
- In > 90% of cases, the rupture occurs in the distal third of the esophagus on the left dorsolateral wall surface. 
- The musculature of the left distal dorsolateral esophageal wall is weaker and therefore offers less resistance.
----
### Epidemiology
- M > F

---
### Presentation
- Mackler triad 
	- Vomiting +/- Retching
	- Sudden severe retrosternal pain due to 
	- development of [[Pneumomediastinum]] demonstrated by suprasternal crepitus on auscultation (Hamman sign) 
- Dyspnea, Dysphagia
- following an event of raised [[Intra-abdominal pressure]] 
- History of recent endoscopy: Symptoms usually occur within 24 hours of endoscopy.
- Delayed presentations: critically ill with sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction
#### Clinical signs
- [[Subcutaneous emphysema]]
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Vomiting
- Epigastric tenderness
- Hematemesis: uncommon

---
### Diagnostics
- X-ray chest
	- Widened mediastinum
	- Pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous emphysema 
	- Pleural effusion
- Neck x-ray : subcutaneous emphysema. It is done If there is suspicion for cervical esophageal perforation (e.g., following upper endoscopy)

##### Confirmatory tests
- Contrast Esophagography using gastrograffin: Gold standard
- CECT 
	- If inconclusive in contrast esophagogram
	- Patient unstable/uncooperative
	- [[Pneumoperitoneum]] detected on X-ray
- Flexible endoscopy
	- Typically reserved for patients with penetrating external esophageal injury
	- May miss injury from inside 

---
### Management
- [[Primary survey]]
- Nil per oral
- IV PPI
- Broad spectrum IV antibiotics
- Parenteral analgesia

##### Non-surgical treatment
- Small, contained perforation indicated in: 
	- Either a contained leak with the neck, within the mediastinum, or between the mediastinum and visceral lung pleura
	- Contrast can flow back into the esophagus from the cavity surrounding the perforation.

##### Surgical management
- Indications
	- Hemodynamic instability
	- Patients who do not fulfill the criteria for conservative management 
	- Clinical deterioration during conservative management
- Procedure
	- Closure of the ruptured esophageal segment
	- Last resort: esophagectomy

### Complications
- [[Mediastinitis]]
- [[Subcutaneous emphysema]]
- [[Pleural effusion]]
- [[sepsis]]
