### Notes
Hemophilia is caused by an [[X-linked recessive]] defect (inherited or spontaneous mutation) or antibody production against clotting factors.
	- Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency): ∼ 80% of cases
	- Hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency): ∼ 20% of cases
	- Hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency): very rare (increased frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population); caused by an [[autosomal recessive]] defect

### Presentation
- Onset since early childhood
- [[secondary hemostasis]] 
- [[Hemarthrosis]] 
- [[mucocutaneous bleeding]] 
- Deep bleeding
	- CNS: ICH   
	- GIT: UGI bleeding, 
	- Hematuria
##### Severity
1. Mild: Hematoma following severe trauma (5-50% remaining): Use desmopressin in Hemophilia A 
2. Moderate: Hematoma following mild trauma (< 5%)
3. Severe: Spontaneous hematoma ( < 1%)

### investigation 
- [[Prothrombin time]]: Normal
- [[Partial thromboplastin time]]: Increased
- [[Bleeding time]]: Normal
- [[Mixing study]]: Normalization of PTT 
- F8/9 activity: reduced
- Genetic testing especially in female 

## Treatment
- [[Desmopressin]]: 
	- Triggers the release of vWF from endothelial cells, which leads to an increase in factor VIII plasma concentration
	- Mild deficiency of VIII, released vWF stabilizes it
- Severe: Prophylactic substitution of respective factor
	- ADR: sensitization, [[Anaphylaxis]]
- Avoid contact sports
- [[Cryoprecipitate]] 
- [[Tranexamic acid]], [[Aminocaproic acid]] in addition
- [[Emicizumab]]

### Complications
- [[hemophilic arthropathy]] 

### Causes of low Clotting factors
- Hereditary: Autosomal recessive
- [[Chronic liver disease]] 
- [[Vitamin K deficiency]] deficiency
- Warfarin 
- Autoimmune
- [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]]
