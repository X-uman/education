### Infantile beriberi
- Clinical onset typically occurs between ages two and three months.
- Mainly affects infants breastfed by mothers with thiamine-deficient diets.
- Variable clinical features may include:
    - Fulminant cardiac syndrome with symptoms such as cardiomegaly, tachycardia, cyanosis, dyspnea, vomiting, and pulmonary hypertension.
    - Neurologic symptoms resembling [[Aseptic meningitis]] in older infants, including, see [[pediatric meningitis]]
- No abnormalities typically found on cerebrospinal fluid analysis in cases of neurologic symptoms.
- Treatment involves parenteral administration of thiamine, with doses ranging from 100 to 150 mg in infants, leading to rapid symptom improvement.
- In 2003, infantile beriberi discovered in Israeli infants fed a soy-based formula deficient in thiamine.
- Infants with severe symptoms at diagnosis, including cardiomyopathy and seizures, often experienced permanent disabilities even after thiamine replacement.
- Infants presenting with apnea or seizures had moderate or severe intellectual disability upon follow-up, with many developing chronic epilepsy.
- Some severely affected infants died.
- Asymptomatic or mildly affected infants may show nonspecific symptoms like vomiting, irritability, or failure to thrive.
- Follow-up testing revealed delays in language and motor development in mildly affected infants.
