###### Etiology
- #MCC in newborn is [[Atresias]], Annular pancreas, midgut [[Volvulus]], [[Meconium ileus]]
- #MCC in children is [[Intussusception]] 
- #MCC in small bowel is [[Intestinal Adhesions]]
- #MCC in large bowel is Left sided [[Colonic cancers]] (Napkin ring)

### Dynamic vs non-dynamic obstruction

- Non-dynamic = Peristalsis impaired
	- [[Paralytic ileus]]   

#### Pathophysiology
- Obstruction
- Bacterial overgrowth, increased translocation through wall and [[SIRS]], [[Peritonitis]]
		- [[Hypotension]] and [[Septic shock]]
- Bowel wall edema and [[Vascular insufficiency]]: 
- Closed loop obstruction: [[Ischemia]] and [[Perforations]]
- Increased peristalsis and secretion inside bowel cavity
	- [[Electrolytes]] abnormalities
	- [[Hypoventilation]] ?

More detail: 
- Bowel obstruction → stasis of luminal contents and gas proximal to the obstruction → ↑ intraluminal pressure, which leads to the following:
	- Gaseous abdominal distention → sequestration of fluids within the distended bowel loops (third spacing) → [[dehydration]] and hypovolemia
	- [[Vomiting]] → loss of fluid and Na+, K+, H+, and Cl- → hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypovolemia
	- Compression of intestinal veins and lymphatics → bowel wall edema → compression of intestinal arterioles and capillaries → [[bowel ischemia]], which leads to:
		- ↑ Bowel wall permeability → translocation of intestinal microbes to the peritoneal cavity → sepsis
		- [[Necrosis]] and perforation of the bowel wall → [[peritonitis]]
		- Anaerobic metabolism and lysis of ischemic cells → accumulation of lactic acid and release of intracellular K+ → metabolic acidosis and [[hyperkalemia]]

#### Presentation
2. Colicky [[Abdominal pain]] due to increased peristalsis
	- Colicky becoming Dull pain is ominous: indicates [[Vascular insufficiency]]
4.  Vomiting proximally (More proximal obstruction, vomiting more prominent)
	- Bilious vomiting
	- Feculent vomiting when iliocecal valve is incompetent in [[Large bowel obstruction]] or after Bacterial overgrowth
1.Distal obstruction: [[Obstipation]] and [[Constipation]] more prominent in distal
	 [[Abdominal distension]] due to bacterial overgrowth and gas production
1. #signs Exaggerated bowel sounds in dynamic obstruction

#### Based on loop 
1. Open loop obstruction 
2. Closed loop obstruction
	- [[Volvulus]] 
	- [[Strangulated hernia]] 
	- Iliocecal valve can act as a second obstruction in large bowel obstruction and lead to massive distension and bowel [[Perforations]]/Rupture

#### Investigation
- #ioc is CECT with Oral [[Gastrograffin]] constrast
- Supine X-ray: For screening
	- Air column >2.5cm diameter
	- String of pearl: Fluid and less air due to air bubbles 
	![[Pasted image 20240420223915.png]]
- Erect X-ray
	>- 5 Air fluid levels in step ladder pattern
	>- Distended bowel loops

| Intestine | Diameter |
| --------- | -------- |
| SI        | 3 cm     |
| LI        | 6 cm     |
| Cecum     | 9 cm     |

- Dynamic complete SI obstruction: no gas in [[Large Intestine]]
- Adynamic/partial obstruction: Gas present [[Paralytic ileus]] 
- [[Pneumoperitoneum]] and [[Pneumoretroperitoneum]] in cases of [[Bowel perforation]] 
- Bowel [[Edema]] leading to thickened walls: Keyboard sign in USG for plica circularis
- [[Radiology of volvulus]]

#### Management
- [[Conservative Management]] 
	- Management of [[Intestinal Adhesions]] 
	- Management of [[GIT Hernias]]
	- Sun should never set nor rise after patient is admitted: Do not delay #surgery, as intestine goes into [[necrosis]]
- #surgery How to identify small vs large bowel obstruction
	- Cecum distension in [[Large Intestine]] obstruction only, but might not be distended in incompetent in ileocecal [[valves]].
