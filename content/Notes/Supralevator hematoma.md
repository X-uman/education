Causes:
- Extension of [[cervical laceration]] or Primary [[Colporrhexis]]
- LUS rupture [[Uterine Rupture]] 
- Spontaneous rupture of [[paravaginal venous plexus]]

Diagnosis:
- C/F:
	- [[Concealed hemorrhage]] and [[Notes/shock]] following delivery
	- abdominal swelling above inguinal ligament pushing uterus to contralateral side.
	- Vaginal examination reveals occlusion of vaginal canal or boggy swelling felt through fornix
	- [[Per rectal examination]]: Boggy mass
- USG needed to localize hematoma

Management:
- Resuscitation from shock
- Anterior leaf of Broad ligament is incised and blood clot scooped, bleeding points secured and ligated
- Random blind sutures to be avoided to prevent [[ureteric injury]]
- If oozing continues, tie anterior division of [[Internal iliac artery]]
- Presence of Ruptured uterus may modify treatment
