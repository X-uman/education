### Examples
- [[Normal saline]]
- [[Ringer's lactate]]

- Dextrose saline (1 liter of 5% solution gives 400 kcal)

### Regimens
- Give several liters of IV isotonic (0.9%) saline as rapidly as possible to patients with signs of shock.
- Give IV isotonic (0.9%) saline at 15 to 20 mL/kg per hour (ie, 1 to 1.5 L per hour for an average-sized adult), in the absence of cardiac compromise, for the first few hours to hypovolemic patients without shock.
