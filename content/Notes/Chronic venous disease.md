### Introduction
- Umbrella term for a variety of manifestations caused by chronic [[Venous hypertension]]  in lower limb
- [[CEAP classification]] 
- most guideline definitions limit the term Chronic venous insufficiency to more advanced disease
---
### Etiology
- Risk factors for CVD include the following:
    - Increasing age and female sex
    - Family history of venous disease
    - Ligamentous laxity
    - Sedentary lifestyle and prolonged standing
    - Obesity
    - Pregnancy
    - Smoking
    - Prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) causing post-thrombotic syndrome
    - Prior extremity trauma
    - Congenital abnormalities


---
### Pathogenesis
- [[Varicose veins]]: [[Venous hypertension]] which leads to valvular regurgitation into superficial veins and back into extremity which further elevated venous pressure. It is no longer thought that venous incompetence is caused by a primary mechanical valvular failure.
- Chronic venous insufficiency: [[Varicose veins]] → extravasation of protein and leukocytes → release of free radicals → damage to capillary basement membrane → leakage of plasma proteins → edema formation → ↓ oxygen supply → tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia → inflammation and atrophy → possibly [[venous ulcers]] formation

---
### Presentation
- F>M
- [[Varicose veins]]
- [[Telangiectesia]] or reticular veins
- Peripheral [[edema]]
- Skin changes: e.g. [[Stasis dermatitis]] 
- [[venous ulcers]]

### Diagnostics

| Assessment                                              | Additional Studies                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Assess patients according to CEAP classification        | - History and examination<br>- [[Duplex USG]] |
| **Additional studies**                                  |                                               |
| Suspected [[suprainguinal venous obstruction]]:         | - USG (A+P)<br>- CT/MR venography             |
| Diagnostic uncertainty                                  | Contrast venography, Intravascular USG        |
| Evaluate for concurrent [[peripheral arterial disease]] |                                               |
| for [[recurrent DVT]], young age, or atypical site      | Evaluate [[thrombophilia panel]]              |
| [[venous ulcers]]                                       | CBC, Metabolic panel, microbiology            |
| [[Venous plethysmography]]                              | Planned intervention                          |

### Complications
- [[Stasis dermatitis]]
- [[venous ulcers]]
- Varicose vein hemorrhage
- [[superficial thrombophlebitis]]
- [[Deep vein thrombosis]], which can occur after procedural interventions
