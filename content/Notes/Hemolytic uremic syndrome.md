### Introduction
- [[Endothelial dysfunction]] due to bacterial toxins especially in [[Glomerulus]] 
	- enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7.
- [[Platelet adhesion]] and [[Thrombosis]]: consumption of platelets and resultant [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia]] 
	- [[microvascular thrombosis]] leading to [[Acute Kidney Injury]] 
	- [[Microangiopathic hemolysis]] mainly the Renal microcirculation
- local form of [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]]???
- PT/PTT: Normal/increased as in [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura]] ([[primary hemostasis]]) i.e. with/without [[Consumption coagulopathy]] 

### Clinical features
- Toddler ( 5 y ) or preschooler with history of bloody [[diarrhea]] caused by enterohemorrhagic [[E coli]] 0157:H7 strain or [[shigella dysenteriae]] since 5-10 d 
- Presents with 
	- [[microvascular thrombosis]] 
		- Thrombocytopenia: [[mucocutaneous bleeding]]
		- [[Intravascular Hemolysis]]: [[Anemia]], Jaundice
		- [[Acute Kidney Injury]] (MCC of AKI in children)
		- Brain involved in 20% of cases: Stroke, hemorrhage, ICP raised
		- GIT: same as TTP

### Complications
- 20% have CNS involvement
- GIT: [[Ischemic Colitis]], Bowel necrosis, perforation, intussuception, stricture
- Heart: ischemia, MI, [[Fluid overload]]
- Pancreas: Infarction and [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
- Kidney: [[CKD]] 

### Diagnostics
- [[Hemolytic markers]]
- CBC: [[Notes/Thrombocytopenia|Thrombocytopenia]] , [[Normocytic anemia]]  
- Coagulation panel
	- Normal/slightly elevated PT/APTT
	- Normal/slightly elevated FDP/D-dimers
- RFT: [[AKI.canvas|AKI]] 
- Urine: hematuria, Proteinuria, Oliguria 

### complications
- [[arterial thrombosis]]
- [[CKD]] 
### management
- [[Supportive measures]] 
	- manage AKI: 
		- Maintain Fluids, electrolytes, pH balance
		- [[Dialysis]] 
	- packed RBC for hemolysis
	- [[Anti-Epileptic therapy]] for seizures
	- Avoid [[antibiotics]] and [[antimotility agents]]; may increase the likelihood of HUS in suspected infection with EHEC
- [[Plasmapheresis]] if refractory 
- Platelet transfusions should be administered with caution unless patients are bleeding or require an invasive procedure. 
	- Some studies suggest that they can exacerbate thrombosis and intravascular hemolysis.
- [[Eculizumab]] for [[atypical HUS]] or for patients with [[Altered consciousness]]
