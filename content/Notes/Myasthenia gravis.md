## Etiologies
- [[Neuromuscular Junction]] 
- [[Thymoma]] (Do Chest CT), Thymectomy indicated if confirmed 
- [[AChE-inhibitors]] 
- Associated with
	- [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]
	- [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
	- [[Sarcoidosis]]
	- [[SLE]]
	- [[Thymic hyperplasia]]
	- [[Thymoma]]
	- [[graft-versus-host disease]] after Stem cell transplantation in children

### Exacerbating factors
- Infection
- Surgery, anesthesia
- Pregnancy
- Medications
	   - Antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides)
	   - Cardiovascular drugs (e.g., procainamide, quinidine, beta blockers)
	   - Psychiatric drugs (e.g., chlorpromazine, risperidone, lithium)
	   - Glucocorticoids

### Presentation
- Ocular MG: most common initial presentation in generalized disease 
	- Asymmetrical [[Ptosis]], Diplopia
- Symmetrical Limb weakness
- Normal Autonomic system, reflexes
##### Clinical tests

| Test                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ice-pack test**         | Used to differentiate between myasthenic and neurogenic ptosis.<br>Application of ice pack for 2 minutes. If improvement in ptosis observed, it's likely myasthenia gravis. |
| **Curtain sign**          | Eyelids droop simultaneously when one eyelid is manually elevated.                                                                                                          |
| **Cogan lid twitch sign** | Jerky upward movement of the upper eyelid seen when the patient looks downward and then rapidly upward.                                                                     |
| **Simpson test**          | A maneuver where the patient is asked to look up under closed eyelids. A downward flick of the eyelid indicates latent ptosis.                                              |

### Diagnosis
- Initial test: Anti-AChR Antibodies
	- If negative: Anti-MuSK Antibodies, in consultation with neurologist
- Additional studies
	- [[Electromyography]]
	- Chest CT
	- Edrophonium test #obsolete has high false positive rates

### Complications
- [[Myasthenic crisis]] needs [[Endotracheal intubation]], [[Plasmapheresis]] 
- [[Myasthenia in pregnancy]] 

### Management
- [[AChE-inhibitors]] for symptomatic treatment
- [[Glucocorticoids]] 
- [[Immunosuppressant drugs]] 
- Thymectomy can improve symptoms even without  abnormalities
### DDx
- [[Lambert Eaton Syndrome]]  
- [[Congenital myasthenic syndrome]]
- [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]
- [[Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia]]
