- Severity: Alkali burns > Acid burns
- HF acid: [[Hypocalcemia]], [[Arrhythmias]]

### management 
- Copious irrigation with warm water is the most appropriate initial step in management for the majority of chemical skin burns. It dilutes and removes the offending agent from the skin. 
- Irrigation should be continued until the pH of the affected tissue has become neutral, which may take several hours in case of alkaline burns.
- The only exceptions to this rule are burns caused by elemental metals (e.g., potassium, magnesium) and dry lime. In these cases, adding water can cause a chemical reaction that would worsen the burn; mineral oil should be used instead.
- HF acid: 
	- 10% Calcium Gluconate gel applied 
	- severe: Bier's block and Intravenous Calcium gluconate, Arrythmias: Debridement, dont do SSG
	- [[Intravenous regional anaesthesia]]
