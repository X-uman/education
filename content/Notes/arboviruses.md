- All RNA viruses are SS except Reoviridae, Orbivirus,
- Insect viruses and Viruses of Vertebrates that are transmitted mechanically do not come under this category
- Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Reoviridae, Arenaviridae, Filoviridae
- Bunyaviridae–Bunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Nairovirus, Hantavirus

### Characteristic features
- Ability to multiply in arthropods is the special characterstic
- Commonest Vectors–Mosquitos, followed by ticks
- Less common vectors–Phlebotomus, Culicoides, Cimicidae
- Cultivation–Mice are used commonly
- Intracerebral Inoculation in suckling mice–Most sensitive method for isolation
- Also grown in yolk sac or chorioattqantoic membrane of chick embryo, in tissue cultures of primary cells like chick embryo fibroblasts or continuous cells like Vero or HeLa and in cultures of appropiate insect tissues
- Resistance
	- Labile–Inactivated at room temperature
	- Bile salts and Ether and other lipid solvents
	- Infectivity may be retained at -70ºC or by Lyophilization

### Antigenic Structure
- Hemagglutinins
- Complement fixing antigens
- Neutralizing Antigens
- Antigenic cross–reactions may occur among Arboviruses
- [[Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test(PRNT)]] shows greatest specificity for identification of Viruses
- [[Hemagglutination]]


### Pathogenicity
- Produce 3 Main Clinical Entities
	- Fever with or without rashes
	- Hemorrhagic Fevers–produce thrombocytopenia and immune complex
	- Encephalitis
- Enters the body by bite of infected Vector, and Multiplies in Reticuloendothelial system
- After Multiplication, Enters the Blood stream and causes Viremia of Varying Duration, and sometimes it is transported to target organs such as
	- CNS in Encephalitis
	- Liver in Yellow Fever
	- Capillary Endothelium in Hemorrhagic fevers
- Case Fatality in Hemorrhagic fevers and Encephalitis is Often High
- All infections occur with varying degrees of severity, subclinical infections being common
- Also cause Veterinary Diseases like
	- Eastern, Western and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis in Horses in America
	- Rift Valley fever in Sheep and Cattle in Africa
	- Blue Tongue in Donkeys in India

- Laboratory Diagnosis
	- May be established by Virus Isolation or Serology
