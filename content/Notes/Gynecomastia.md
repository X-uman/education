### Introduction
- Gynecomastia is a clinical diagnosis confirmed by identifying palpable glandular tissue on physical examination.
- Size is generally taken as > 4 cm 
### Etiology
| Mechanism                           | Conditions/Pathologies                                                                                                                                                 |

| Various mechanisms                  | - Cimetidine <br> - Imatinib <br> - Anti-retroviral drugs                                                                                                              |

### Clinical presentation
- Firm, concentric, typically mobile mass in the subareolar region
- May be tender 
- Typically bilateral
- In pathological gynecomastia: possible features of undervirilization, hyperthyroidism, liver/kidney disease, etc.
### Diagnosis
- testosterone, Estradiol and androstenedione, LH and [[β-hCG]] 
- LFT, RFT, TFT
- [[Sex hormones]]
- Breast imaging
	- Age < 25: USG
	- Age >= 25: Mammography or DBT
- [[Testicular ultrasonography]] 
- Neuroimaging: for suspected [[Prolactinoma]] 

### Management
- Treat underlying cause
	- Low testosterone: HRT
	- Tumor: see [[Testicular cancer]]
	- Hyperthyroidism 
- Physiological and idiopathic gynecomastia
	- Reassurance and follow-up every 6 months
	- Provide analgesia 
	- Persistent: consider drugs or surgery
- Drugs: [[SERMs]] can reduce size and pain
- Surgery for long-standing unresponsive gynecomastia
	- Nipple-sparing Subcutaneous mastectomy with periareolar incision
	- Suction lipectomy
### Differential diagnosis
- Pseudo-gynecomastia
	- Sub-areolar fatty tissue without evidence of a discrete subareolar mass on palpation
	- Seen in obese individuals
	- No evidence of breast tissue on imaging
	- Often resolves spontaneously
- Male breast cancer
- Lipoma
- [[Mastitis]]
