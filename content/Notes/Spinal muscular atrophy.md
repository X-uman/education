### Pathogenesis
- [[Apoptosis]] of Lower Motor Neurons i.e. Anterior horn cells in later stages of fetal development and postnatal period 
- Complete Loss of [[SMN-1]] Gene on [[Chromosome 5]] 
- [[Autosomal recessive]]
- Severity depends upon number of copies of SMN-2 Genes on the same chromosome
### Presentation
- [[LMN Lesions]] 
- Presentation similar to [[Poliomyelitis]] ?
- Both Bulbar and Spinal symptoms except Ocular and Sacral motor neurons 
	- Preserved [[Extraocular muscles]] motility
	- Preserved Continence 
- Sensory system intact
- The most common causes of death in individuals with SMA are respiratory insufficiency (due to respiratory muscle weakness) and aspiration pneumonia (due to bulbar weakness)
- [[UMN vs LMN symptoms]] : LMN symptoms seen
- Type I → non-sitters, type II → sitters, type III → walkers
- [[Hip dislocation]]
- [[Joint contractures]]
- [[Kyphosis]], [[Scoliosis]] 
### Diagnosis
- Genetic testing: best initial and confirmatory test
- Further tests
	- Muscle biopsy: atrophy of groups of motor units interspersed with normal or hypertrophied motor units
	- [[Electromyography]] : spontaneous, large-amplitude, low-frequency electrical activity (rarified interference pattern)
	- Laboratory tests: normal or mildly elevated creatine kinase (see [[Myolysis Markers]])

### Differential diagnoses
- [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] 
	- IN ALS both upper and lower motor neurons are affected, so both UMN and LMN features can be observed 
	- ALS Happens in older age, on average 55 y 
### Management
- [[Antisense therapy]]: [[Nusinersen]] is highly effective in halting the progression of disease
- [[Onasemnogene abeparvovec]]: Potentially curative
- Supportive therapy
	- Respiratory, Nutritional, Physical, Orthopedic
