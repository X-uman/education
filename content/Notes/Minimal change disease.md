### Introduction
- commonest cause of [[Nephrotic Syndrome]] in children
- aka Lipoid nephrosis 
### Etiologies
  - Infection
  - Immunization
  - HLA Haplotypes
  - Atopy
  - [[Lymphomas]] 
### Pathogenesis
  - Leads to T-cells dysfunction → Cytokines → Neutralize GBM (Glomerular Basement Membrane) Charge Barrier (Glomerular Polyanions loss)
### Pathology
##### Light Microscopy 
  - Normal Glomeruli, hence called Minimal Change Disease
  - Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) cells accumulate fat (also known as Lipoid Nephrosis)
  - Normal Cellularity
##### Electron Microscopy
  - Effacement of foot processes of podocytes, allowing proteins to leak, hence EM is needed for diagnosis.
##### Immunofluorescence
  - No Immune Complex

### Clinical Features
  - Affects children (2-6 years old), with a history of immunization
  - Highly selective heavy proteinuria and lipiduria
  - Good response to corticosteroids
  - Does not recur
### Treatment
- Prednisolone 60 mg/day for 6 weeks
- Followed by 40 mg/day for next 6 weeks on alternate days
- Frequent relapses/resistance: [[Cyclophosphamide]], Cyclosporine or [[Rituximab]] to induce remissions
